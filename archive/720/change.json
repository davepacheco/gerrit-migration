Major\nversion compat is definitely the most important thing for consuming clients to\nbe able to not break. Supporting minor versions is debatable. Basically allowing\nclients to request specific minor versions feels like featuritis to me. So...\nthat debate should happen with an RFD.\n\n2. *this* change *is* big, so I can see where wanting to having a ver bump more\nthan a patch-level would be wanted.

It just doesn\u0027t strike me as a patch release: too much going on.\n\nFor publishing major versions only: I have no opinion on that. Sounds reasonable, and frankly cloudapi hasn\u0027t been especially rigorous with semver in the past (e.g. adding new attributes to existing JSON).
