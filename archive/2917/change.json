Yeah it\u0027s tough because you have to be aware of an implementation detail of the dashdash parser (https://github.com/trentm/node-dashdash/blob/master/lib/dashdash.js#L93-L104) and keep that in mind. It would be nice to have a way to avoid this problem in the future, but I don\u0027t now exactly what that would look like. Even if we had the options parser return a set of functions based on the options provided we would still face the same issue where the function would need to be named role_tag() rather than role-tag(), though at least in that case the linter might catch during development.\n\nI guess my feeling is that while the status quo isn\u0027t ideal I don\u0027t have a great idea for a path to make it better and given the frequency with which new options are added it\u0027s probably not worth the time right now. We could definitely file an issue against node-manta to explore other options on this down the road though."},{"timestamp":1533162059,"reviewer":{"name":"Kelly McLaughlin","email":"kelly.mclaughlin@joyent.com","username":"kellymclaughlin"},"message":"Uploaded patch set 4."},{"timestamp":1533162061,"reviewer":{"name":"Kelly McLaughlin","email":"kelly.mclaughlin@joyent.com","username":"kellymclaughlin"},"message":"Patch Set 4:\n\nNew commits:\n    \n    commit ba675b80aafa9e8786ce36d5f2792af6802c85f7\n    \n    joyent/node-manta#333 The --role-tag option does not work for mput, muntar, mln, or mmkdir\n    Fix the --role-tag option for mput, muntar, mln, and mmkdir.
