-# Overview
-
-The SDC headnode GZ has historically had a number of `sdc-*` tools in
-"/opt/smartdc/bin" (e.g. sdc-vmapi, sdc-ldap). These live(d) in
-usb-headnode.git. Because they are not installed via an image they
-weren't upgradeable via SAPI. To support the later an 'sdc' core
-zone (akin to the Manta 'ops') zone was created. This repo is it.
