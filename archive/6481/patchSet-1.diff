+## Creating Gerrit reviews against a branch
+
+It can be useful to create Gerrit reviews with a base branch other than
+'master'. For this to work, the branch has to be pushed into cr.joyent.us.
+If our base branch is `my-dev-branch`:
+
+1. make sure your local check-out of the base branch is identical to that hosted
+   on github (same SHA for HEAD).
+
+1. add yourself to "Temporary Git Superusers" via the
+   [gerrit admin interface](https://cr.joyent.us/#/admin/groups/).
+
+1. push that base branch directly to `cr.joyent.us`:
+
+       $ git push cr HEAD:refs/heads/my-dev-branch
+       $ export BRANCH=my-dev-branch
+
+1. remove yourself from "Temporary Git Superusers"
+
+1. Now, you can create Gerrit reviews against that branch as needed, by using
+   the magical `refs/for/<branchname>`:
+
+       $ git checkout my-latest-dev-work
+       $ git push cr HEAD:refs/for/my-dev-branch
