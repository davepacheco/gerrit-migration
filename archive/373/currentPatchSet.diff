    The node-fast2 repository on GitHub has been renamed to node-fast.  To avoid dealing with rename in Gerrit, I'm going to reimport "node-fast" and decommission "node-fast2".  To decomission "node-fast2", I'm changing its parent project from GitHub-Replication so that it will be no longer replicated.
