Also alter to use newest version o\nf node-sdc-clients.\n```\n\nwhich is before `triton package list` existed. \n\nSo:\n\n- `triton package list name\u003d~FOO` never worked.\n- The escapeParam JS code (in the PAPI index.md docs and used in node-sdc-clients/lib/papi.js) has at least two bugs in it: (a) it only escapes the first occurrence of a special char and (b) it will escape \u0027\\\\\u0027 in an escape code:\n\n```\n\u003e esc(\u0027*a(s)\\\\Xdf*\u0027)\n\u0027{\\\\2a}a{{\\\\5c}28}s{\\\\29}\\\\Xdf*\u0027\n```\n\nMarsell,\n\nCould you please take on a few things:\n\n1. Fix the escapeParam code in lib/papi.js\n2. Fix the suggested JS escape code in PAPI\u0027s docs/index.md\n3. Start a PUBAPI ticket to support (or at least discuss) passing through the \u0027*\u0027 char in cloudapi\u0027s ListPackages?name\u003d*FOO* to PAPI\u0027s ListPackages. \n\nSeparately I\u0027d be curious whether the feature added in PAPI-78 is used at all. The ticket doesn\u0027t include why that feature was added. This is the change that led to adding escaping of special chars."}],"currentPatchSet":{"number":"2","revision":"2d04ae942c557691d8c1c221f2ca895e4601eca2","parents":["f806e5ae26ee34e08842f81540c726bce34d4431"],"ref":"refs/changes/19/1619/2","uploader":{"name":"Yang Yong","email":"yy1111.yang@samsung.com","username":"YangYong3"},"createdOn":1488861842,"author":{"name":"Yang Yong","email":"yy1111.yang@samsung.com","username":"YangYong3"},"isDraft":false,"kind":"REWORK","approvals":[{"type":"CI-Testing","description":"CI-Testing","value":"1","grantedOn":1488861867,"by":{"name":"Joyent Automation","username":"joyent-automation"}},{"type":"Code-Review","description":"Code-Review","value":"1","grantedOn":1488863278,"by":{"name":"Marsell Kukuljevic","email":"marsell@joyent.com","username":"marsell"}},{"type":"Integration-Approval","description":"Integration-Approval","value":"1","grantedOn":1488863278,"by":{"name":"Marsell Kukuljevic","email":"marsell@joyent.com","username":"marsell"}},{"type":"Code-Review","description":"Code-Review","value":"-1","grantedOn":1489707699,"by":{"name":"Trent Mick","email":"trentm@gmail.com","username":"trentm"}},{"type":"Integration-Approval","description":"Integration-Approval","value":"-1","grantedOn":1489707699,"by":{"name":"Trent Mick","email":"trentm@gmail.com","username":"trentm"}}],"files":[{"file":"/COMMIT_MSG","type":"ADDED","insertions":7,"deletions":0},{"file":"lib/papi.js","type":"MODIFIED","insertions":6,"deletions":-1},{"file":"test/api.test.js","type":"MODIFIED","insertions":8,"deletions":0},{"file":"tools/rsync-to","type":"ADDED","insertions":51,"deletions":0}],"sizeInsertions":65,"sizeDeletions":-1},"patchSets":[{"number":"1","revision":"c5aae75b4588fc0290191ac4135e6838b926119a","parents":["f806e5ae26ee34e08842f81540c726bce34d4431"],"ref":"refs/changes/19/1619/1","uploader":{"name":"Yang Yong","email":"yy1111.yang@samsung.com","username":"YangYong3"},"createdOn":1488859094,"author":{"name":"Yang Yong","email":"yy1111.yang@samsung.com","username":"YangYong3"},"isDraft":false,"kind":"REWORK","approvals":[{"type":"CI-Testing","description":"CI-Testing","value":"1","grantedOn":1488859124,"by":{"name":"Joyent Automation","username":"joyent-automation"}}],"files":[{"file":"/COMMIT_MSG","type":"ADDED","insertions":7,"deletions":0},{"file":"lib/papi.js","type":"MODIFIED","insertions":6,"deletions":-1},{"file":"tools/rsync-to","type":"ADDED","insertions":51,"deletions":0}],"sizeInsertions":57,"sizeDeletions":-1},{"number":"2","revision":"2d04ae942c557691d8c1c221f2ca895e4601eca2","parents":["f806e5ae26ee34e08842f81540c726bce34d4431"],"ref":"refs/changes/19/1619/2","uploader":{"name":"Yang Yong","email":"yy1111.yang@samsung.com","username":"YangYong3"},"createdOn":1488861842,"author":{"name":"Yang Yong","email":"yy1111.yang@samsung.com","username":"YangYong3"},"isDraft":false,"kind":"REWORK","approvals":[{"type":"CI-Testing","description":"CI-Testing","value":"1","grantedOn":1488861867,"by":{"name":"Joyent Automation","username":"joyent-automation"}},{"type":"Code-Review","description":"Code-Review","value":"-1","grantedOn":1489707699,"by":{"name":"Trent Mick","email":"trentm@gmail.com","username":"trentm"}},{"type":"Integration-Approval","description":"Integration-Approval","value":"-1","grantedOn":1489707699,"by":{"name":"Trent Mick","email":"trentm@gmail.com","username":"trentm"}},{"type":"Code-Review","description":"Code-Review","value":"1","grantedOn":1488863278,"by":{"name":"Marsell Kukuljevic","email":"marsell@joyent.com","username":"marsell"}},{"type":"Integration-Approval","description":"Integration-Approval","value":"1","grantedOn":1488863278,"by":{"name":"Marsell Kukuljevic","email":"marsell@joyent.com","username":"marsell"}}],"files":[{"file":"/COMMIT_MSG","type":"ADDED","insertions":7,"deletions":0},{"file":"lib/papi.js","type":"MODIFIED","insertions":6,"deletions":-1},{"file":"test/api.test.js","type":"MODIFIED","insertions":8,"deletions":0},{"file":"tools/rsync-to","type":"ADDED","insertions":51,"deletions":0}],"sizeInsertions":65,"sizeDeletions":-1}],"allReviewers":[{"name":"Joyent Automation","username":"joyent-automation"},{"name":"Trent Mick","email":"trentm@gmail.com","username":"trentm"},{"name":"Marsell Kukuljevic","email":"marsell@joyent.com","username":"marsell"},{"name":"Yang Yong","email":"yy1111.yang@samsung.com","username":"YangYong3"}]}
