used now in the related muskie PR. We already do a good bit of splitting and joining with the request key in muskie. I wonder if we\u0027re better off deciding in muskie what sort of request this is and then having muskie call the listObjects and listBuckets APIs directly. Most of the other interfaces node-boray provides are already in terms of the specific request type and have the parameters broken out. I think keeping that consistent makes it less confusing about where to go to look for the decision about the type of request.
