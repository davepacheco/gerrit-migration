+
+2. License Grants and Conditions
+--------------------------------
+
+2.1. Grants
+
+Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
+non-exclusive license:
+
+(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
+    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
+    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
+    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
+    as part of a Larger Work; and
+
+(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
+    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
+    Contributions or its Contributor Version.
+
+2.2. Effective Date
+
+The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
+become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
+distributes such Contribution.
+
+2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
+
+The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
+this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
+distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
+Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
+Contributor:
+
+(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
+    or
+
+(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
+    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
+    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
+    Version); or
+
+(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
+    its Contributions.
+
+This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
+or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
+the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
+
+2.4. Subsequent Licenses
+
+No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
+distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
+License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
+permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
+
+2.5. Representation
+
+Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
+Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
+to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
+
+2.6. Fair Use
+
+This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
+applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
+equivalents.
+
+2.7. Conditions
+
+Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
+in Section 2.1.
+
+3. Responsibilities
+-------------------
+
+3.1. Distribution of Source Form
+
+All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
+Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
+the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
+Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
+License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
+attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
+Form.
+
+3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
+
+If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
+
+(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
+    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
+    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
+    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
+    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
+
+(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
+    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
+    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
+    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
+
+3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
+
+You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
+provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
+the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
+Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
+Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
+License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
+under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
+the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
+Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
+License(s).
+
+3.4. Notices
+
+You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
+(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
+or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
+the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
+the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
+
+3.5. Application of Additional Terms
+
+You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
+indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
+Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
+behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
+such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
+You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
+liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
+indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
+disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
+jurisdiction.
+
+4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
+---------------------------------------------------
+
+If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
+License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
+statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
+the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
+describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
+be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
+Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
+or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
+recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
+
+5. Termination
+--------------
+
+5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
+if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
+compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
+Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
+Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
+ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
+non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
+come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
+Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
+notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
+first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
+from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
+Your receipt of the notice.
+
+5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
+infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
+counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
+directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
+You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
+2.1 of this License shall terminate.
+
+5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
+end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
+have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
+prior to termination shall survive termination.

+*  Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is"       *
+*  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or  *
+*  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       *
+*  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *
+*  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     *
+*  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *
+*  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *
+*  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *
+*  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *
+*  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *
+*  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         *
+*                                                                      *

+*  Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort      *
+*  (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any           *
+*  Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as          *
+*  permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,         *
+*  special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character      *
+*  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *
+*  goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any    *
+*  and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party      *
+*  shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This   *
+*  limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or   *
+*  personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the       *
+*  extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some               *
+*  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *
+*  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          *
+*  limitation may not apply to You.                                    *
+*                                                                      *
+************************************************************************
+
+8. Litigation
+-------------
+
+Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
+courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
+place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
+jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
+Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
+cross-claims or counter-claims.
+
+9. Miscellaneous
+----------------
+
+This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
+matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
+unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
+necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
+that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
+shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
+
+10. Versions of the License
+---------------------------
+
+10.1. New Versions
+
+Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
+10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
+publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
+distinguishing version number.
+
+10.2. Effect of New Versions
+
+You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
+of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
+or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
+steward.
+
+10.3. Modified Versions
+
+If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
+create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
+modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
+any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
+such modified license differs from this License).
+
+10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
+Licenses
+
+If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
+Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
