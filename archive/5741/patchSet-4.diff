+# EXPENSIVE TARGETS AND MAKE STAMP FILES
+#
+# Targets which are expensive to run and lack a single file that marks
+# completion are difficult to track with make; e.g., "npm install".  One
+# solution to this problem is to create "stamp" files with symbolic names which
+# are created as the final step in a complex make rule in order to mark
+# completion.
+#
+# In order to make these more uniform, and easier to target with "make clean",
+# we will attempt to store them under a single directory.  Note that these
+# files are never targets for shipping in build artefacts.
+#
+# Stamp-backed targets come in several parts.  First, a macro should be defined
+# which names a file in the MAKE_STAMPS_DIR directory.  Then, a target which
+# creates this stamp file must be provided.  The recipe for this target should
+# use MAKE_STAMP_REMOVE and MAKE_STAMP_CREATE to perform the appropriate stamp
+# management.
+#
+# For example:
+#
+# --- Makefile.*.defs:
+#
+#	$(STAMP_EXPENSIVE_RESULT) := $(MAKE_STAMPS_DIR)/expensive-result
+#
+# --- Makefile.*.targ:

+#		rm -rf output_tree/  # <--- ensure a clean slate
+#		expensive_program -o output_tree/ $^
+#		$(MAKE_STAMP_CREATE)

+#
+# Then push those changes to gerrit as usual for review.
+#
+
+#
+# This Makefile facilitates building and bundling your own copy of Node.js in
+# your repo.  All it does is define variables for node, node-waf, and npm for
+# you to use elsewhere in your Makefile and rules to build these tools when
+# needed.
+#
+# To use this facility, include "Makefile.node.defs", use the variables as
+# described below to define targets, and then include "Makefile.node.targ".
+#
+# There are two use cases addressed here:
+#
+# (1) Invoking node, node-waf, or npm as part of the build process, as in "npm
+#     install" and "node-waf configure build".  To facilitate this, this
+#     Makefile defines Make variables NODE, NODE_WAF, and NPM that you can use
+#     to invoke these commands during the build process.  You MUST NOT assume
+#     that these variables just evaluate to the filenames themselves, as they
+#     may have environment variable definitions and other things that prevent
+#     you from using them directly as a filename.  If you want that, see (2).
+#
+#     Wherever you use one of these variables, you MUST include a dependency on
+#     the corresponding *_EXEC variable as well, like so:
+#
+#	node_modules/restify: deps/restify $(NPM_EXEC)
+#		$(NPM) install deps/restify
+#
+#     or better, use an order-only dependency to avoid spurious rebuilds:
+#
+#	node_modules/restify: deps/restify | $(NPM_EXEC)
+#		$(NPM) install deps/restify
+#
+#     Otherwise, the underlying file will not get built.  We don't
+#     automatically build them as part of "all" because that approach is
+#     brittle.
+#
+# (2) Specifying paths for invoking node, node-waf, or npm at RUNTIME, as in
+#     specifying the path to node used for the start method of your service's
+#     SMF manifest.  For this, this Makefile defines variables NODE_EXEC,
+#     NODE_WAF_EXEC, and NPM_EXEC, which represent the relative paths of these
+#     files from the root of the workspace.  You MUST NOT use these variables
+#     to invoke these commands during the build process.  See (1) instead.
+#
+#     However, in order to work at runtime, you must build the tool as well.
+#     That is, if you use NODE_EXEC to specify the path to node, you must
+#     depend on NODE_EXEC somewhere. This usually happens anyway because you
+#     usually need them during the build process too, but if you don't then
+#     you need to explicitly add NODE_EXEC (or whichever) to your "all"
+#     target.
+#
+# When including this Makefile, you MAY also specify:
+#
+#	BUILD			top-level directory for built binaries
+#				(default: "build")
+#
+#	NODE_INSTALL		where node should install its built items
+#				(default: "$BUILD/node")

+# Makefile.node_prebuilt.defs: Makefile for including a prebuilt Node.js build.
+#
+
+#
+# NOTE: This makefile comes from the "eng" repo. If you find yourself changing
+# this file, you should ensure that you test all consumers of it, since
+# eng.git is a git submodule of several repositories. After testing, push
+# changes to the eng.git gerrit project as normal, then do the following for

+#
+#    $ git submodule update --remote deps/eng

+#
+# Then push those changes to gerrit as usual for review.
+#
+
+#
+# This Makefile facilitates downloading and bundling a prebuilt node.js
+# build (using the 'sdcnode' distro builds). This is an alternative to
+# the "Makefile.node.*" makefiles for *building* a node from source.
+#
+# Usage:
+#
+# - Define `NODE_PREBUILT_VERSION` in your Makefile to choose a node version.
+#   E.g.: `NODE_PREBUILT_VERSION=v0.6.19`. See other optional variables
+#   below.
+# - `include deps/eng/tools/mk/Makefile.node_prebuilt.defs` after this in
+#   your Makefile.
+# - `include deps/eng/tools/mk/Makefile.node_prebuilt.targ` near the end of
+#   your Makefile.
+# - Have at least one of your Makefile targets depend on either `$(NODE_EXEC)`
+#   or `$(NPM_EXEC)`. E.g.:
+#
+#		node_modules/restify: deps/restify $(NPM_EXEC)
+#			$(NPM) install deps/restify
+#
+#   or better, use an order-only dependency to avoid spurious rebuilds:
+#
+#		node_modules/restify: deps/restify | $(NPM_EXEC)
+#			$(NPM) install deps/restify
+#
+# - Use `$(NPM)` or `$(NODE)` to use your node build.
+# - Include the "$(NODE_INSTALL)" tree in your release package.
+#
+#
+# When including this Makefile, you MUST also specify:
+#
+#	NODE_PREBUILT_VERSION 	The node version in the prebuilt 'sdcnode'
+#				package to use. Typically this is one of the
+#				node version tags, e.g. "v0.6.18" but it
+#				can be any commitish.
+#
+# When including this Makefile, you MAY also specify:
+#
+#	NODE_PREBUILT_DIR 	The dir in which to find sdcnode builds. This
+#				can either be a *local directory* or *a
+#				URL* dir (with trailing '/') which serves
+#				Apache/Nginx dir listing HTML.
+#				(default: sdcnode master build dir on stuff)
+#
+#	NODE_PREBUILT_TAG	The 'sdcnode' project supports special
+#				configuration builds of node, e.g. say a
+#				build configured `--without-ssl`. These
+#				special configurations are given a tag, e.g.
+#				'gz', that is used in the filename. Optionally
+#				specify a tag name here.
+#				(default: empty)
+#
+#	NODE_PREBUILT_BRANCH	Specify a particular branch of 'sdcnode' builds
+#				from which to pull. Generally one should stick
+#				with the default.
+#				(default: master)
+#
+#	NODE_PREBUILT_IMAGE		If you have a zone image that differs from that
+#				for an sdcnode build that you want to use (potential compat
+#				issues be damned), then set this to the UUID of the sdcnode
+#				build you want. See here for available build image uuids:
+#				<https://download.joyent.com/pub/build/sdcnode/master-latest/sdcnode/>
+#
+#	BUILD			top-level directory for built binaries
+#				(default: "build")
+#
+#	NODE_INSTALL		where node should install its built items
+#				(default: "$BUILD/node")
+#
+#
+# Dev Notes:
+#
+# This works by getting "NODE_PREBUILT_NAME" from the provided "NODE_PREBUILT_*"
+# vars and the image version (via 'mdata-get sdc:image_uuid'). The image uuid is
+# included to ensure an exact match with the build machine. This name (e.g.
+# "v0.6.18-zone-$uuid") is used to find a matching "sdcnode-$name-*.tgz" build
+# in "NODE_PREBUILT_DIR" (either a local directory or a URL). That tarball is
+# downloaded and extracted into "NODE_INSTALL".
+#
+# The "*_EXEC" vars are set to named symlinks, e.g.
+# "build/prebuilt-node-v0.6.18-$uuid", so that a change of selected node
+# build (say the developer changes NODE_PREBUILT_VERSION) will recreate the
+# node install.
+#
+# See <https://mo.joyent.com/docs/sdcnode/master/> for details on 'sdcnode-*'
+# package naming.
