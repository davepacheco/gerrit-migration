What kind of testing\n \u003e have\n \u003e \u003e you done already?\n \u003e \n \u003e I\u0027ve tested the changed no-clobber piece in isolation. I\u0027ve tried\n \u003e testing the GC itself -- but my test environment doesn\u0027t have\n \u003e garbage to collect. If there is a standard way to test mako\u0027s GC,\n \u003e I\u0027d love to hear about it.\n\nI think every test environment will clean up some garbage each day.  You should be able to see it by looking at the nightly mako_gc logs.  If you truly have none (which would be surprising, because we run jobs every day that create intermediate objects that should be deleted), you could always create a bunch of data and then remove it.\n\nThis is the testing that I would probably do in a test deployment:\n\n- Deploy this script to at least one storage zone and make sure GC works as normal there.  That doesn\u0027t exercise the changes itself, but is a worthwhile smoke check.\n- I\u0027d also look at a mako_gc log from that run and compare it to a log from a previous run and make sure it looks like what I\u0027d expect, particularly the xtrace output around the lock file logic.\n- Test the original problem described in the ticket: fill up /tmp and wait for mako_gc to run (or run it by hand).  After failing to create the lock file, it should bail out with a clear error message instead of proceeding as it did in the initial report.  After freeing up the disk space and running it again, it should work fine.\n- Kill the script and its children ungracefully (maybe with SIGKILL) and make sure it doesn\u0027t fail the next time it\u0027s run just because the lock file is still around.  This is extra paranoid because I don\u0027t think your changes affected this.\n- Verify the lock file behavior in the context of the script.  One way would be to see how long mako_gc normally takes (from its nightly logs) and then running the program by hand during that period and make sure that the second invocation bails out with a clear error message.  It may be easier to add an extra crontab entry that executes the script in the same way at the same time, but with output redirected to a different file.  One of the runs should fail, and the other should not.\n- `make prepush` in this repository, if that\u0027s pretty easy.  It\u0027s pretty unlikely that that would be affected by this change, but I generally run the the tests anyway because it\u0027s supposed to be easy to do.\n\nThat said, I tend to be a little paranoid about introducing breakage.  Some of this may be overkill.  That said, I think all of that should be reasonably straightforward, and given the importance of this process and its history of silent failures in edge cases that we do hit in production, I think it\u0027s worth proactively verifying end-to-end that it\u0027s working as we expect, even in those edge cases."},{"timestamp":1504637018,"reviewer":{"name":"Tim
