+ * # TritonApi method callback patterns
+ *
+ * Guidelines for the `cb` callback form for TritonApi methods are as follows:
+ *
+ * - Methods that delete a resource (i.e. call DELETE endpoints on cloudapi)
+ *   should have a callback of one of the following forms:
+ *          function (err)
+ *          function (err, res)             # if 'res' is useful to caller
+ *   where `res` is the response object. The latter form is used if there
+ *   is a reasonable use case for a caller needing it.
+ *
+ * - Other methods should have a callback of one of the following forms:
+ *          function (err, theThing)
+ *          function (err, theThing, res)
+ *          function (err, _, res)          # no meaningful body; useful 'res'
+ *          function (err)
+ *   `res` is the response object (from the original cloudapi request, in
+ *   the case of methods that make an async request, and then poll waiting
+ *   for completion). `theThing` is an endpoint-specific object. Typically it
+ *   is the parsed JSON body from the cloudapi response. In some cases there
+ *   is no meaningful response body (e.g. for RenameMachine), but the res can
+ *   be useful. Here we use `_` to put a placeholder for the body, and keep
+ *   `res` in the third position.
