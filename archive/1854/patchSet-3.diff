+# Common Operational Procedures
+
+## Adding a New Storage Node
+
+This procedure provides steps needed to add a new Manta storage node (also
+sometimes called a "shrimp" or "mantis shrimp" in reference to the hardware
+spec used by Joyent for these nodes) to an existing Manta deployment.
+
+### Prerequisites
+
+Prior to following the steps in this document, the server needs to be added to
+Triton using the standard compute node installation process as outlined
+[here](https://github.com/joyent/sdc-cnapi/blob/master/docs/index.md#setting-up-a-new-server).
+
+**Notes:**
+* If link aggregation is being used, the aggregation must be setup prior to
+  continuing the installation process.
+* Do not install VXLAN to any Manta nodes.
+* Assuming you have used the standard Manta networking nictags, the following 
+  must be present on the CN; note that these tags can be
+  added by the `manta-net.sh` script as well. If you have not used the 
+  standard Manta nictags, you will need to adjust accordingly.
+    * admin
+    * external
+    * manta
+    * mantanat
+
+### Traiting the New Storage Node
+
+Once the server is setup, you'll want to add a trait to the CN to ensure that
+no other instances provision to the newly setup shrimp. This tag is not read or
+validated by Manta, so you can use a tag that is descriptive for your
+environment. For example, any of the following would work:
+
+* `{"internal": "Manta Node"}`
+* `{"internal": "Manta Storage"}`
+* `{"manta": "Storage"}`
+
+Adding the above trait can be done via adminUI (operator's portal), or via the
+use of sdc-cnapi:
+
+`headnode# sdc-cnapi /servers/:uuid -X POST -d '{"internal": "Manta Node"}'`
+
+### Initial Data Gathering
+
+Once server setup has been completed, you will need to gather the following
+information. This information will be used to build the necessary configuration
+files to complete the installation of the new Manta storage node.
+
+You should save the data gathered below, as you will be referring to it later
+in the procedure.
+
+Note that some Manta installations can span multiple data centers /
+availability zones. For example, the Manta deployment in US-EAST uses US-EAST-1,
+US-EAST-2, and US-EAST-3. Be sure that you have identified all datacenters that
+are taking part in your Manta deployment.
+
+#### Current System Configuration
+
+
+    headnode# sdc-cnapi /servers/715020ea-11e1-11e4-bb8a-002590e4edcc | \
+    json -Ha hostname traits \
+    sysinfo."Link Aggregations" \
+    sysinfo."Virtual Network Interfaces" \
+    sysinfo."Network Interfaces"
+
+#### Network Details
+
+Note that this assumes you have used the standard nictag names for your
+Manta networks. If not, you will need to adjust appropriately.
+
+    headnode# for NETWORK in admin manta mantanat ; do
+    sdc-napi /networks?name=$NETWORK | json -H
+    done
+
+#### Datacenter Details
+
+    headnode# egrep -i "^datacenter_name|^region_name" /usbkey/config
+
+### Steps to Add New Storage Node
+
+#### Step 1: Apply Networking
+
+* Ensure that you are running the latest supported version of the
+  Manta deployment zone
+
+  `headnode# sdcadm update manta`
+
+* Run the `setup_manta_zone.sh` command on the headnode
+
+  This setup updates the GZ level tooling for Manta, and includes links to
+  commands such as:
+
+    * `manta-oneach`
+    * `manta-login`
+    * `manta-adm`
+
+  `headnode# /usbkey/scripts/setup_manta_zone.sh`
+
+* Build out the Network File
+
+  This is a JSON blob that contains information on the networks as well as the
+  storage node that is being added. This file is populated with the data that was
+  collected in the information gathering phase above. The example file below shows
+  the addition of a new storage node (532abfa0-11df-11e4-94d3-002590e4f150) to a
+  single AZ deployment called *swdemo01*. Please see the 
+  [Networking Configuration](https://github.com/joyent/manta/blob/master/docs/operator-guide/index.md#networking-configuration)
+  section of the Manta Operators Guide for more information.

+            }
+        }
+        }
+            
+* Follow step 4 from the 
+  [Deploying Manta](https://github.com/joyent/manta/blob/master/docs/operator-guide/index.md#deploying-manta)
+  steps above.
+    
+#### Deploy Services 
+    
+* Add Blocks for New Storage Node to the Configuration File
+  This step will be run from the Manta deployment zone, which you can log into via
+  `sdc-login -l manta` from the GZ on the headnode.
+    
+    `manta# manta-adm show -sj > /var/tmp/newstorage.json`
+    
+    Edit the `newstorage.json` file to add a new block for each of the new servers;
+    for example, here is a stanza from a demo environment:
+
+            {
+            "532abfa0-11df-11e4-94d3-002590e4f150": {
+                "storage": {
+                "3554bca8-42d4-11e4-90be-0b874336d056": 4
+                },
+                "marlin": {
+                "05726737-917f-43d2-97a7-8b55d85cddf9": 10
+                }
+            }
+            }
+
+    For your new storage node you will need to edit the server UUID:
+
+            {
+            "NEW-SERVER-UUID": {
+                "storage": {
+                "3554bca8-42d4-11e4-90be-0b874336d056": 4
+                },
+                "marlin": {
+                "05726737-917f-43d2-97a7-8b55d85cddf9": 10
+                }
+            }
+            }
+
+    Each storage node should have one and only one mako. The number of marlin nodes
+    is highly dependent on the amount of memory in the server, as well as the
+    intended balance of storage versus compute. Provided that the new storage
+    hardware is the same as the hardware already in use, you should be able to use
+    the same number of marlins. If not, you will need to review the server resources
+    in order to determine the number of marlins to deploy.
+    
+* Deploy the New Zones
+    
+  Once the configuration file is complete, you can run it with the following
+  command:
+    
+    `manta# manta-adm update /var/tmp/newstorage.json`
+
+  This command will call the necessary utilities to ensure that the zones are
+  created and configured appropriately. If you encounter any errors, you will need
+  to resolve them prior to moving on.
+    
+* Deploy the marlin agent
+
+  This step will ensure the marlin agent is
+  enabled on the new storage node.
+    
+    `manta# manta-marlin -s [server_uuid]`
+    
+  The marlin agent is deployed via the normal agent process in Triton (ie, the
+  "sdcadm experimental update-agents").
+    
+#### Updates and Verification
+    
+* Update the marlin dashboard
+    
+        headnode#  manta-login marlin-dashboard
+        marlin-dashboard$ /opt/smartdc/marlin-dashboard/bin/generate-config.js | bunyan
+        marlin-dashboard$ svcadm restart marlin-dashboard
+            
+  If you encounter any errors at this point, you will need to remediate them.
+    
+* Update madtom
+    
+        headnode# manta-login madtom
+        madtom$ /opt/smartdc/madtom/bin/generate_hosts_config.js | bunyan
+        madtom$ svcadm restart madtom
+    
+  If you encounter any errors at this point, you will need to remediate them.
+    
+* Clear any Open Manta Alarms
+
+  This is done from inside the Manta deployment zone.
+    
+        manta# mantamon alarms
+        manta# mantamon clear <alarm id>
+    
+* Update Alarms
+
+  This is done within the Manta deployment zone. Note that you will need to re-run
+  the `mantamon drop` until the count reaches 0 prior to running the
+  `mantamon add`.
+
+        manta# mantamon drop
+        manta# mantamon add
+
+* Verification
+
+  At this point you want to confirm the following:
+    * Check marlin dashboard to confirm you see the new storage node and the
+      appropriate number of marlins.
+    * Check madtom to verify all services are green.
+    * Monitor for next 24 hours to confirm new shrimp is receiving jobs and data
+    * One way to help push this process along is to kick off a run of
+      [manta-mlive](https://github.com/joyent/manta-mlive), which should result in
+      objects being written / removed from the new servers. You should see data being
+      written inside the new mako zones under `/manta`.
