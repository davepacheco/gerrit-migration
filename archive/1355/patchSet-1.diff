+
+## NAME
+
+delmany - delete multiple objects using a filter
+
+## SYNOPSIS
+
+`delmany [COMMON_OPTIONS] [-l LIMIT] [-o OFFSET] BUCKET FILTER`
+
+## DESCRIPTION
+
+Deletes objects from bucket `BUCKET` whose properties match the filter `FILTER`.
+Like `findobjects`, `delmany` operations are always bounded in size.  See the
+`-l LIMIT` option.  You must use multiple invocations to remove arbitrarily
+large lists of objects.
+
+`FILTER` is an LDAP-like filter string described in `findobjects(1)`.  The
+caveats described there around the use of unindexed fields apply to filters used
+with `delmany` as well.
+
+## OPTIONS
+
+`-l LIMIT`
+  Remove at most `LIMIT` objects.  This interacts badly with filters on
+  unindexed fields, as described in `findobjects(1)`.  If this option is
+  unspecified, a default limit is provided (which is currently 1000).
+
+`-o OFFSET`
+  Skip the first `OFFSET` objects matching the filter.
+  <!-- XXX is that right? -->
+
+See `moray(1)` for information about the `COMMON_OPTIONS`, which control
+the log verbosity and how to locate the remote server.

+# findobjects 1 "December 2016" Moray "Moray Client Tools"
+
+## NAME
+
+findobjects - fetch the contents of multiple objects using a filter
+
+## SYNOPSIS
+
+`findobjects [COMMON_OPTIONS] [-Hns] [-a FIELD] [-d FIELD] [-l LIMIT] [-o OFFSET] BUCKET FILTER`
+
+## DESCRIPTION
+
+Fetches objects from bucket `BUCKET` whose properties match the filter `FILTER`.
+Matching objects are printed as JSON objects similar to the `getobject` command,
+with properties `bucket`, `key`, `value`, `_id`, and `_etag`.  This command also
+provides an additional JSON property on each object:
+
+`_count`
+  A count of total objects matching this filter on the server.  See the
+  important caveats below.
+
+`findobjects` operations are always bounded in size.  See the `-l LIMIT` option.
+You must use multiple invocations using the `-l LIMIT` and `-o OFFSET` options
+(called _pagination_) to process arbitrarily large sets of objects.
+
+`FILTER` is an LDAP-like filter string.  For example, this filter matches
+objects having property "hostname" with value "wormhole":
+
+    (hostname=wormhole)
+
+This filter matches objects having a "unix\_timestamp" property at most
+1482438844:
+
+    (unix_timestamp<=1482438844)
+
+This filter matches objects meeting both constraints:
+
+    (&(hostname=wormhole)(unix_timestamp<=1482438844))
+
+And this filter matches objects meeting either one:
+
+    (|(hostname=wormhole)(unix_timestamp<=1482438844))
+
+In order to avoid expensive table scans, Moray requires that filter strings use
+at least one of the bucket's indexed fields in a way that could prune results
+(e.g., not just on one side of an "OR" clause).  Note that you can still
+construct filters that require table scans (e.g., `(hostname=*)`), and
+reasonable-looking filters can still behave pathologically.  Performance depends
+significantly on the behavior of the underlying data store.  The requirement
+around indexed fields is a heuristic to prevent obviously-pathological behavior,
+not a guarantee of good behavior.
+
+Filters can include both indexed and unindexed fields, but **using unindexed
+fields in filters is strongly discouraged.**  They cannot be used correctly with
+pagination (the `-o OFFSET` and `-l LIMIT` options) and they do not produce
+correct values for `_count`.  Attempting to use these options with filters that
+use unindexed fields often results in truncated result sets.
+
+
+## OPTIONS
+
+`-a FIELD`
+  Sort results in ascending order by indexed field `FIELD`.
+
+`-d DESC`
+  Sort results in descending order by indexed field `FIELD`.
+
+`-H`
+  Print objects using minimal JSON with one object per line (instead of
+  inserting newlines within objects and indenting for readability)
+
+`-l LIMIT`
+  Return at most `LIMIT` objects.  With `-o OFFSET`, this can be used to page
+  through a large result set.  However, this interacts badly with filters on
+  undexed fields as described above.  If this option is unspecified, a default
+  limit is provided (which is currently 1000).
+
+`-n`
+  Do not report the `_count` field with each object.  (This also skips
+  executing the underlying query on the server to perform the count.)
+
+`-o OFFSET`
+  Skip the first `OFFSET` objects matching the filter.  With `-l LIMIT`, this
+  can be used to page through a large result set.
+  <!-- XXX is that right? -->
+
+`-s`
+  Do not execute the query, but instead report the SQL strings that would be
+  used to execute the query on the underlying data store.
+
+See `moray(1)` for information about the `COMMON_OPTIONS`, which control
+the log verbosity and how to locate the remote server.
+
+## ENVIRONMENT
+
+See `moray(1)` for information about the `LOG_LEVEL`, `MORAY_SERVICE`, and
+`MORAY_URL` environment variables.

+## EXAMPLES

+## SEE ALSO
+
+`moray(1)`, `putbucket(1)`, `putobject(1)`, `getobject(1)`, `delmany(1)`,
+`updatemany(1)`.
+
+## BUGS
+
+For the reasons mentioned above, it is generally considered a bug that Moray
+allows filter strings to use unindexed fields.  This is likely to change in
+future versions.

+# gettokens 1 "December 2016" Moray "Moray Client Tools"
+
+## NAME
+
+gettokens - fetch the list of shards from electric-moray
+
+## SYNOPSIS
+
+`gettokens [COMMON_OPTIONS]`
+
+## DESCRIPTION
+
+Reports the list of physical shards behind an electric-moray instance.
+
+Electric-moray is a component typically deployed in front of several separate
+Moray shards.  Electric-moray instances speak the Moray protocol to their
+clients, but they use consistent hashing on some field of each object to select
+the appropriate backend to handle each request.  (This functions similar to a
+layer-7 load balancer.)  A full discussion of electric-moray is beyond the scope
+of this documentation.
+
+For this command, the service specified with the `COMMON_OPTIONS` should be an
+electric-moray instance, not a moray instance.
+
+## OPTIONS
+
+See `moray(1)` for information about the `COMMON_OPTIONS`, which control
+the log verbosity and how to locate the remote server.
+
+## ENVIRONMENT
+
+See `moray(1)` for information about the `LOG_LEVEL`, `MORAY_SERVICE`, and
+`MORAY_URL` environment variables.
+
+## EXAMPLES
+
+<!-- XXX -->
+
+## SEE ALSO
+
+`moray(1)`
+
+## BUGS
+
+It's not clear why backend shards are called "tokens".
+
+This command likely belongs with an electric-moray tool suite, rather than the
+Moray tool suite.

+
+## NAME
+
+moray - command-line tools for Moray
+
+## DESCRIPTION
+
+Moray is a JSON-based key-value store.  Users can create **buckets**, each
+containing any number of **objects** indexed by a primary **key**.  Additional
+indexes can be specified with each bucket.  Moray servers are typically
+stateless components deployed atop PostgreSQL databases, where buckets
+correspond to database tables, objects correspond to rows, and database indexes
+are created for each bucket index.
+
+The `moray` npm package contains a set of command-line tools to allow users to
+create, update, and delete both buckets and objects.  These tools connect to one
+or more remote Moray servers over TCP and execute operations.
+
+Working with buckets:
+
+* `putbucket`: create or update a bucket
+* `getbucket`: print detailed information about one bucket
+* `listbuckets`: print detailed information about all buckets
+* `delbucket`: delete a bucket and all of its contents
+
+Working with objects:
+
+* `putobject`: create or update an object
+* `getobject`: fetch the contents of an object by primary key
+* `delobject`: delete an object by primary key
+* `findobjects`: fetch the contents of multiple objects using a filter
+* `delmany`: delete multiple objects using a filter
+* `updatemany`: update multiple objects using a filter
+* `reindexobjects`: populate a newly-added index
+
+Working with remote servers:
+
+* `morayping`: check whether Moray is online
+* `morayversion`: check the version of a Moray server
+* `sql`: execute a SQL string on a Moray server
+* `gettokens`: fetch the list of shards from electric-moray
+
+The tools in this package support two modes for locating the remote Moray server
+on which to operate:
+
+* Using the `-S`/`--service SERVICE_NAME` option or the `MORAY_SERVICE`
+  environment variable, users specify a DNS domain to which SRV records are
+  attached that describe the list of instances available.  SRV records provide
+  both a name for the host (which may be an IP address or another DNS domain)
+  and a port on which to connect over TCP.  This mode is preferred for
+  general use because it provides information about all instances and allows the
+  client to balance multiple requests across different, equivalent servers.
+* Using the `-h`/`--host HOST_OR_IP` and `-p`/`--port PORT` options or the
+  `MORAY_URL` environment variable, users specify a specific IP address or DNS
+  domain to which traditional name records are attached and a TCP port to which
+  to connect.  This is useful primarily for testing against specific server
+  instances.
+
+If the `-S`/`--service SERVICE_NAME` command-line option is specified, it is
+always used directly as described above.
+
+If the `-h`/`--host HOST_OR_IP` or `-p`/`--port PORT` options are specified,
+they are used directly as described above.  If one is specified and not the
+other, then the other value is filled in from the `MORAY_URL` environment
+variable.  Otherwise, defaults of IP `127.0.0.1` and port `2020` are used.
+
+If none of these command-line options are specified:
+
+- if `MORAY_SERVICE` is specified, it is used to invoke the first mode
+- if `MORAY_URL` is specified, is used to invoke the second mode
+- if neither is specified, the second mode is invoked with default values
+  `127.0.0.1` port `2020`.
+
+## OPTIONS
+
+The following `COMMON_OPTIONS` options are accepted by all of these commands:
+
+`-b, --bootstrap-domain BOOTSTRAP_DOMAIN`
+  Specifies the domain name for the nameservers themselves.  Triton and Manta
+  both provide domain names for the nameservers themselves.  This is useful in
+  split DNS environments to ensure that the Moray only uses the nameservers
+  that know about the target service.  This applies to both SRV-record-based
+  discovery and traditional A-record-based discovery, but has no impact when
+  connecting to a specific IP address and port.
+
+`-h, --host HOST_OR_IP`
+  Specifies an IP address or DNS domain for the remote Moray server.  See
+  above for details.
+
+`-p, --port PORT`
+  Specifies the TCP port for the remote Moray server.  See above for details.
+
+`-S, --service SERVICE`
+  Specifies a DNS domain to be used for SRV-based service discovery of the
+  remote Moray server.  See above for details.  `SERVICE` must not be an IP
+  address.
+
+`-v, --verbose`
+  Increases the verbosity of the built-in bunyan logger.  By default, the
+  logger is created with bunyan level `fatal`.  Each additional use of `-v`
+  increases the verbosity by one level (to `error`, `warn`, and so on).  Log
+  messages are emitted to stderr.  See also the `LOG_LEVEL` environment
+  variable.
+
+## ENVIRONMENT
+
+`LOG_LEVEL`
+  Sets the node-bunyan logging level. Defaults to "fatal".
+
+`MORAY_BOOTSTRAP_DOMAIN`
+  Used as a fallback value for the `-b`/`--bootstrap-domain` option.
+
+`MORAY_SERVICE`
+  Used as a fallback value for `-S`/`--service` if neither of `-h`/`--host` or
+  `-p`/`--port` is specified.
+
+`MORAY_URL`
+  A URL of the form `tcp://HOSTNAME_OR_IP[:PORT]` where the specified
+  `HOSTNAME_OR_IP` and `PORT` will be used as fallback values for the
+  `-h`/`--host` or `-p/--port` options, respectively.  This value is only used
+  if `MORAY_SERVICE` is not present in the environment and at least one of the
+  `-h`/`--host` or `-p`/`--port` options is not specified.
+
+## EXIT STATUS
+
+0
+  Indicates successful completion

+
+## NAME
+
+morayping - check if a Moray server is functioning
+
+## SYNOPSIS
+
+`morayping [COMMON_OPTIONS] [-dF]`
+
+## DESCRIPTION
+
+Attempts to determine whether Moray is functioning.  For this command, success
+indicates that Moray is functioning and able to respond to a request.  Failure
+indicates the command could not successfully connect and complete a request.
+
+## OPTIONS
+
+`-d`
+  Attempt to determine whether Moray has a working connection to its
+  underlying data store by making a "deep" ping request instead of a trivial
+  request.
+
+`-F`
+  Block until at least one Moray server is found and a connection is
+  established, then execute the ping request.  This is intended to
+  programmatically wait for Moray to become available, although if the request
+  fails (e.g., because of a network issue), the request is not retried, and in
+  this case Moray may still be down.
+
+See `moray(1)` for information about the `COMMON_OPTIONS`, which control
+the log verbosity and how to locate the remote server.

+# morayversion 1 "December 2016" Moray "Moray Client Tools"
+
+## NAME
+
+morayversion - report the version of a Moray server
+
+## SYNOPSIS
+
+`morayversion [COMMON_OPTIONS]`
+
+## DESCRIPTION
+
+Attempts to determine the major version of the Moray server.  **This information
+should not be used programmatically.**  This command is intended primarily for
+operators and developers to use against specific Moray instances, either for
+debugging or in preparation for upgrading.
+
+There are important caveats about this operation:
+
+- It's always possible for an operator to upgrade or rollback a Moray server
+  immediately after this command is executed.  It's not safe to assume that the
+  value returned by this command will not change over time.
+- With most forms of service discovery (described in `moray(1)`), this request
+  may be made against any of a number of different Moray server instances.  But
+  different Moray instances may be running different versions.  This case
+  further demonstrates that it's not safe to assume that the value returned by
+  this command will not change over time, even from one millisecond to the next.
+- Old versions of Moray do not respond to the version request at all.  On such
+  servers, this command will time out (currently after 20 seconds).  It's
+  impossible to know if a timeout indicates an old version, a bug or hang on the
+  remote server, or a network issue.
+
+These caveats generally make this command unsuitable for programmatic use.
+
+## OPTIONS
+
+See `moray(1)` for information about the `COMMON_OPTIONS`, which control
+the log verbosity and how to locate the remote server.
+
+## ENVIRONMENT
+
+See `moray(1)` for information about the `LOG_LEVEL`, `MORAY_SERVICE`, and

+# putbucket 1 "December 2016" Moray "Moray Client Tools"
+
+## NAME
+
+putbucket - create or update a bucket
+
+## SYNOPSIS
+
+`putbucket [COMMON_OPTIONS] [-st] [-i FIELD[:TYPE]...] [-u FIELD[:TYPE]...] [-x VERSION] BUCKET`
+
+## DESCRIPTION
+
+Creates or updates a bucket in Moray called `BUCKET`.  If the bucket does not
+exist, it is created.  If the bucket already exists and has a version, the
+bucket will only be updated if `-x` is specified and `VERSION` is greater than
+the version of the bucket on the server.
+
+A bucket's configuration includes:
+
+* a list of field names (also referred to as a **schema**) that describes the
+  top-level properties for which database indexes should be created.  These
+  indexes enable querying and manipulation using filters accepted by the
+  `findobjects`, `updatemany`, and `delmany` tools.
+* an optional version number, which is used to coordinate schema updates among
+  multiple clients having different versions.
+* a set of options defined by the server.  The only option supported by this
+  tool is `trackModification`.
+* `pre` and `post` triggers, which are functions executed on the Moray server
+
+Users may specify the bucket configuration using a combination of the `-i`,
+`-u`, `-x`, or `-t` options, or using the `-s` option and providing a JSON
+description on stdin.  The `-s` option must be used for specifying `pre` and
+`post` triggers.
+
+When you use `putbucket(1)` to add a new indexed field, that field will not be
+treated as indexed (in filters with `findobjects` and similar tools) until all
+objects in the bucket have been reindexed.  See `reindexobjects(1)`.
+
+## OPTIONS
+
+`-i FIELD[:TYPE]`
+  Adds an index on the top-level property called `FIELD`.  `FIELD` can
+  subsequently be used in filters for `findobjects`, `updatemany`, and
+  `delmany` operations.  The optional `TYPE` is interpreted by the server.
+
+`-s`
+  Read the bucket's configuration from stdin rather than the other
+  command-line options.  Other bucket-related command-line options are
+  ignored.
+
+`-t`
+  Enable the `trackModification` server-side option for this bucket.
+
+`-u FIELD[:TYPE]`
+  Adds an index just like the `[-i]` option, but additionally require that
+  values of field `FIELD` must be unique within the bucket.  Attempting to
+  insert a second object having the same value of `FIELD` as another object in
+  the bucket will fail.  This constraint is maintained by the underlying data
+  store.
+
+`-x VERSION`
+  Only create or update the bucket if it does not already exist on the server,
+  or if it exists with no version number, or if it exists with a version
+  number that's older than `VERSION`.  The new `VERSION` is stored with the
+  bucket configuration.
+
+See `moray(1)` for information about the `COMMON_OPTIONS`, which control
+the log verbosity and how to locate the remote server.
+
+The JSON read from stdin may have the following properties:
+
+`indexes`
+  an object whose properties identify each of the indexed fields.  Each value
+  is an object with properties `type` (a string) and `unique` (a boolean).
+
+`options`
+  an object describing options interpreted by the server.  This may include
+  the `trackModification` option, which should be a boolean value.
+
+`post`, `pre`
+  arrays of strings containing JavaScript functions to be executed before
+  (`pre`) or after (`post`) various operations.  See server documentation for
+  details.  The strings themselves are evaluated in the context of this tool.
+
+`version`
+  an integer version number, as would be specified with `-x`
+
+Default values are provided that correspond to this configuration:
+
+    {
+        "indexes": {},
+        "options": {},
+        "pre": [],
+        "post": []
+    }
+
+By default, the bucket is not versioned.
+
+
+## ENVIRONMENT
+
+See `moray(1)` for information about the `LOG_LEVEL`, `MORAY_SERVICE`, and
+`MORAY_URL` environment variables.
+
+## EXAMPLES
+
+<!-- XXX -->
+
+## SEE ALSO
+
+`moray(1)`, `reindexobjects(1)`
+
+## BUGS
+
+The JSON format is not validated on the client side.  Future versions of this
+tool may validate input on the client.

+# putobject 1 "December 2016" Moray "Moray Client Tools"
+
+## NAME
+
+putobject - create or update an object
+
+## SYNOPSIS
+
+`putobject [COMMON_OPTIONS] [-d DATA] [-e ETAG] BUCKET KEY`
+
+## DESCRIPTION
+
+Creates or updates an object in bucket `BUCKET` with primary key `KEY`.  If no
+object exists having the same key, a new object is created.  If the object
+exists (and if its etag matches `ETAG`, if `-e` was specified), then the old
+object is overwritten and atomically replaced with the new one.  The object's
+contents are specified by the JSON string `DATA`.
+
+## OPTIONS
+
+`-d DATA`
+  Specifies the contents of the object as a JSON string.  Generally, objects
+  should conform to a user-defined schema, having a fixed set of properties
+  and types.  However, there are no constraints imposed by the server other
+  than uniqueness for fields that are specifically marked unique in the bucket
+  configuration.  Top-level properties of the object that correspond to
+  indexed fields will be extracted and included in an index so that it can be
+  queried and updated.  See `putbucket(1)` for details.
+
+`-e ETAG`
+  Only execute this operation if the corresponding object on the server
+  currently has etag `ETAG`.  Etags are computed on the server based on
+  object contents, and they are included in the results of any object fetch
+  operation.  This option can be used to implement optimistic concurrency
+  control (as a form of test-and-set operation).

+# reindexobjects 1 "December 2016" Moray "Moray Client Tools"
+
+## NAME
+
+reindexobjects - populate a newly-added index
+
+## SYNOPSIS
+
+`reindexobjects [COMMON_OPTIONS] BUCKET [COUNT]`
+
+## DESCRIPTION
+
+Reindexing is the process by which the internal representation of objects is
+updated to account for indexes that were added after the object was last
+written.  For example, if you add a new index to a bucket that already contains
+a million objects, it's necessary to examine the raw JSON value of each object,
+extract the value of the newly-indexed field, and add that value to the index.
+Until this has been completed for all objects in the bucket, the index is
+incomplete, and it will not be used in queries with `findobjects` and related
+tools.  Because reindexing every object in the bucket can take quite a while,
+the server does not do it automatically when the index is created with
+`putbucket(1)`.  Instead, users that add indexes must use the `reindexobjects`
+command to reindex all the objects in a bucket.
+
+`reindexobjects` reindexes any objects in bucket `BUCKET` that have not been
+reindexed since the last time an indexed field was added to the bucket (e.g.,
+using `putbucket(1)`).  This operation performs as many queries as necessary,
+each reindexing up to `COUNT` objects (which defaults to 100).  The command
+stops either when all objects have been reindexed or when an error occurs.  This
+operation can take an arbitrarily long time on arbitrarily large buckets.
+
+Reindexing is idempotent.  For each object, this operation updates all indexes
+that were created after the object was written.  If you add multiple indexed
+fields, even in multiple operations, you only need to reindex each object once.
+
+## OPTIONS
+
+See `moray(1)` for information about the `COMMON_OPTIONS`, which control
+the log verbosity and how to locate the remote server.

+## ENVIRONMENT

+
+## NAME
+
+sql - check of a Moray server is functioning
+
+## SYNOPSIS
+
+`sql [COMMON_OPTIONS] SQL`
+
+## DESCRIPTION
+
+Executes a raw SQL command `SQL` against Moray's backing data store.  This is
+intended for experienced operators and developers to run ad hoc queries (usually
+read-only).  A mistake in the `SQL` string can cause all manner of bad behavior,
+including database deadlock, data corruption, and data loss.  This tool and
+Moray perform almost no validation on the input string.
+
+This should not be used as part of normal operation.  Normal operations should
+be first-classed as specific Moray requests with associated tools.
+
+## OPTIONS
+
+See `moray(1)` for information about the `COMMON_OPTIONS`, which control
+the log verbosity and how to locate the remote server.

+## BUGS
+
+Moray removes newlines from all SQL commands that it executes, including those
+specified with this command.  The results can be surprising.  This most commonly
+affects SQL "--" comments, which run to the end of the line.  Since newlines are
+stripped, everything after the first opening "--" gets commented out.

+## NAME

+updatemany - update multiple objects using a filter
+
+## SYNOPSIS
+
+`updatemany [COMMON_OPTIONS] [-d DATA] [-l LIMIT] BUCKET FILTER`
+
+## DESCRIPTION
+
+Updates objects from bucket `BUCKET` whose properties match the filter `FILTER`.
+`DATA` is a JSON object describing what to update.  Properties of `DATA` must be
+indexed fields.  For each matching row, the fields specified in `DATA` will be
+updated to their corresponding values in `DATA`.  Other fields are unchanged.
+
+Like `findobjects`, `updatemany` operations are always bounded in size.  See the
+`-l LIMIT` option.  You must use multiple invocations to update arbitrarily
+large lists of objects.
+
+`FILTER` is an LDAP-like filter string described in `findobjects(1)`.  The
+caveats described there around the use of unindexed fields apply to filters used
+with `updatemany` as well.
+
+## OPTIONS
+
+`-d DATA`
+  Specifies the fields to update in each matching object.
+
+`-l LIMIT`
+  Remove at most `LIMIT` objects.  This interacts badly with filters on
+  unindexed fields, as described in `findobjects(1)`.  If this option is
+  unspecified, a default limit is provided (which is currently 1000).

+# moray 3 "December 2016" Moray "Moray Client Library"
+
+## NAME
+
+moray - Node.js client library for Moray
+
+## DESCRIPTION
+
+Moray is a JSON-based key-value store.  For an overview of Moray, see
+`moray(1)`.  This manual page assumes basic familiarity with the services Moray
+provides, how to use them from the command line, and how both SRV-based service
+discovery and traditional service discovery work from the command line.
+
+The `moray` npm package contains a Node.js client library that allows consumers
+to create, update, and delete both buckets and objects.  The package also
+contains a suite of command-line tools for exercising these interfaces.  When in
+doubt, see the implementation of those tools for examples of using each RPC
+call.
+
+### Creating a client
+
+To interact with Moray, users of the Node library instantiate a Moray client
+object, which requires a bunyan-style logger.  The simplest invocation, which is
+suitable only for one-off tools and test programs, would be to connect to Moray
+on localhost:
+
+    var mod_bunyan = require('bunyan');
+    var mod_moray = require('moray');
+
+    var log = mod_bunyan.createLogger({ name: 'my-tool', level: 'INFO' });
+
+    var client = mod_moray.createClient({
+        log: log,
+        host: '127.0.0.1',
+        port: 2020
+    });
+
+    client.on('connect', function () {
+        /* Start making RPC calls.  This example lists buckets. */
+        client.listBuckets(function (err, buckets) {
+            if (err) {
+                /* This should be handled more gracefully! */
+                throw (err);
+            }
+
+            console.log(JSON.stringify(buckets));
+
+            /* When finished, be sure to close the client. */
+            client.close();
+        });
+    });
+
+This works for a simple test program, but is not suitable for Triton and Manta
+servers or command-line tools for a few reasons:
+
+* This mode does not support SRV-based service discovery, which is critical for
+  increased scalability and improved fault tolerance.  SRV-based discovery is
+  configured by using the `srvDomain` property instead of `host` or `port.`
+* This mode does not enable the client to use bootstrap resolvers, which are
+  critical for use in mixed DNS environments (e.g., where a combination of
+  Triton, Manta, or external namservers may be in use).  Bootstrap resolvers are
+  configured using the `cueballOptions.resolvers` property.
+* Command-line tools should generally specify additional parameters to ensure
+  that they fail quickly when servers are down rather than retrying
+  indefinitely until they are online.  This means specifying `failFast`.  It's
+  also a good idea to specify `mustCloseBeforeNormalProcessExit` to make sure
+  that your tool shuts down cleanly.
+
+Here's a general pattern for *server* components in Triton and Manta to
+configure the Moray client:
+
+    var mod_jsprim = require('jsprim');
+
+    var client, config;
+
+    /*
+     * Extract the Moray client configuration block from the server's
+     * configuration file.  Here, we assume that "serverConfig" came from
+     * parsing the server's configuration file.  We also assume that the
+     * Moray configuration property is just called "moray", but some components
+     * (notably Muskie) have multiple clients, and they would use different
+     * property names (e.g., "picker" or "marlin").
+     */
+    config = jsprim.deepCopy(serverConfig.moray);
+    config.log = log;
+    client = mod_moray.createClient(config);
+    client.on('connect', function onMorayConnect() {
+        /* start using the client */
+    });
+
+*Client* components would usually add an `error` listener, too:
+
+    /*
+     * Client tools add an error listener.  Servers generally should NOT do this
+     * because they configure the client to retry indefinitely.  Any errors
+     * emitted by the client would be programmer errors.
+     */
+    client.on('error', function onError(err) {
+        console.error('moray client error: %s', err.message);
+        process.exit(1);
+    });
+
+In practice, `serverConfig.moray` comes from a SAPI configuration template.  For
+**Triton services**, it will typically look like this:
+
+    {
+        "srvDomain": "{{{MORAY_SERVICE}}}"
+        "cueballOptions": {
+            "resolvers": [ "{{{BINDER_SERVICE}}}" ]
+        }
+    }
+
+That will expand to something like this:
+
+    {
+        "srvDomain": "moray.mydatacenter.joyent.us",
+        "cueballOptions": {
+            "resolvers": [ "binder.mydatacenter.joyent.us" ]
+        }
+    }
+
+For **Manta services**, the template file will typically include a block that
+looks like this:
+
+    {
+        "srvDomain": "{{MARLIN_MORAY_SHARD}}",
+        "cueballOptions": {
+            "resolvers": [ "nameservice.{{DOMAIN_NAME}}" ]
+        }
+    }
+
+That will expand to something like this:
+
+    {
+        "srvDomain": "1.moray.myregion.joyent.us",
+        "cueballOptions": {
+            "resolvers": [ "nameservice.myregion.joyent.us" ]
+        }
+    }
+
+This approach (using a block from the configuration file) allows operators to
+reconfigure a service to point at a specific instance by replacing the
+`srvDomain` property with `host` and `port` properties.
+
+Command-line tools that use Moray should typically define their own options for
+specifying `srvDomain`, `host`, and `port` properties.  See `moray(1)` for the
+command-line options and fallback environment variables used by the built-in
+Moray tools.
+
+Command-line tools should generally also specify `failFast` and
+`mustCloseBeforeNormalProcessExit`.
+
+
+### Making RPC calls
+
+Callers make RPC calls by invoking RPC methods on the client.  The specific
+methods are documented in the [Moray server](https://github.com/joyent/moray)
+reference documentation.
+
+All RPC methods are asynchronous, and they all follow one of two styles
+described in the "Node.js Error Handling" documentat.  The style used depends on
+the kind of data returned by the RPC.
+
+* RPC calls that return a fixed number of results (usually just one object or a
+  small chunk of metadata) are callback-based: the last argument to the RPC
+  method is a callback.  The first argument to the callback is an optional
+  error, and subsequent arguments are RPC-specific.
+* RPC calls that return a large or variable number of results (like
+  `findObjects`) are event-emitter-based: they return an event emitter that
+  emits `error` on failure, `end` on completion, and other events depending on
+  the RPC call.
+
+All of the RPC methods take an optional `options` argument that is always the
+last non-callback argument.  (For callback-based RPCs, it's the second-to-last
+argument.  For event-emitter-based RPCs, it's the last argument.)  You can use
+this to pass in a `req_id` for correlating log entries from one service with
+the Moray client log entries.  Some APIs (namely put/get/del object) have
+additional options to allow cache bypassing, for example.
+
+
+## OPTIONS
+
+The client constructor uses named arguments on a single `args` object.
+
+All constructor invocations must provide:
+
+`log` (object)
+  a bunyan-style logger
+
+All constructor invocations must also provide one of the following:
+
+`srvDomain` (string)
+  DNS domain name for SRV-based service discovery
+
+`url` (string)
+  Describes the hostname or IP address and TCP port to specify a specific
+  Moray server to connect to (instead of using SRV-based service discovery).
+  This is deprecated for servers, and should only be used for tools, for
+  testing, and for unusual, temporary operational changes.  The format for
+  this option is the same as for the `MORAY_URL` environment variable
+  described in `moray(1)`.
+
+`host` (string) and `port` (integer or string)
+  Like `URL`, but specified using different properties.
+
+Callers may also provide:
+
+`cueballOptions` (object)
+  Overrides cueball-related options, including various timeouts and delays.
+  For specific options that can be overridden here, see the source.  **NOTE:
+  it's not expected that most consumers would need to specify any of these.
+  Default values ought to work for the port, DNS service, and all the various
+  timeouts, delays, and retry limits.**
+
+`failFast` (boolean)
+  If true, this sets a more aggressive retry policy, and the client emits
+  "error" when the underlying Cueball set reaches state "failed".  This is
+  intended for use by command-line tools to abort when it looks like dependent
+  servers are down.  Servers should generally not specify this option because
+  they should wait indefinitely for dependent services to come up.
+
+`unwrapErrors` (boolean)
+  If false (the default), Errors emitted by this client and RPC requests will
+  contain a cause chain that explains precisely what happened.  For example,
+  if an RPC fails with SomeError, you'll get back a FastRequestError
+  (indicating a request failure) caused by a FastServerError (indicating that
+  the failure was on the remote server, as opposed to a local or
+  transport-level failure) caused by a SomeError.  In this mode, you should
+  use VError.findCauseByName(err, 'SomeError') to determine whether the root
+  cause was a SomeError.
+  If the "unwrapErrors" option is true, then Fast-level errors are unwrapped
+  and the first non-Fast error in the cause chain is returned.  This is
+  provided primarily for compatibility with legacy code that uses err.name to
+  determine what kind of Error was returned.  New code should prefer
+  VError.findCauseByName() instead.
+
+`mustCloseBeforeNormalProcessExit` (boolean)
+  If true, then cause the program to crash if it would otherwise exit 0 and
+  this client has not been closed.  This is useful for making sure that client
+  consumers clean up after themselves.
+
+Some legacy options are accepted as documented in the source.
+
+## ENVIRONMENT
+
+The `LOG_LEVEL`, `MORAY_SERVICE`, and `MORAY_URL` environment variables are
+interpreted by each command-line tool, not the client library itself.
+
+
+## SEE ALSO
+
+<!-- XXX link -->
+
+`moray(1)`, Moray server reference documentation, Node.js Error Handling
+
+
+## DIAGNOSTICS
+
+The client library logs messages using the bunyan logger.  Increase the log
+level for more verbose output.
+
+The underlying [node-fast](https://github.com/joyent/node-fast) RPC library
+provides DTrace probes on supported systems for inspecting low-level RPC events.
+
+Use Node's `--abort-on-uncaught-exception` command-line argument to enable core
+file generation upon fatal program failure.  These core files can be used with
+[mdb_v8](https://github.com/joyent/mdb_v8) to inspect the program's state at the
+time of the crash.

+In order to avoid expensive table scans, Moray requires that filter strings use

+construct filters that require table scans (e.g., \fB\fC(hostname=*)\fR), and
+reasonable\-looking filters can still behave pathologically.  Performance depends
+significantly on the behavior of the underlying data store.  The requirement
+around indexed fields is a heuristic to prevent obviously\-pathological behavior,
+not a guarantee of good behavior.
+.PP
+Filters can include both indexed and unindexed fields, but \fBusing unindexed
+fields in filters is strongly discouraged.\fP  They cannot be used correctly with

+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.PP
+Reports the list of physical shards behind an electric\-moray instance.
+.PP
+Electric\-moray is a component typically deployed in front of several separate
+Moray shards.  Electric\-moray instances speak the Moray protocol to their
+clients, but they use consistent hashing on some field of each object to select
+the appropriate backend to handle each request.  (This functions similar to a
+layer\-7 load balancer.)  A full discussion of electric\-moray is beyond the scope
+of this documentation.
+.PP
+For this command, the service specified with the \fB\fCCOMMON_OPTIONS\fR should be an
+electric\-moray instance, not a moray instance.

+moray \- command\-line tools for Moray
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.PP
+Moray is a JSON\-based key\-value store.  Users can create \fBbuckets\fP, each
+containing any number of \fBobjects\fP indexed by a primary \fBkey\fP\&.  Additional
+indexes can be specified with each bucket.  Moray servers are typically
+stateless components deployed atop PostgreSQL databases, where buckets
+correspond to database tables, objects correspond to rows, and database indexes
+are created for each bucket index.
+.PP
+The \fB\fCmoray\fR npm package contains a set of command\-line tools to allow users to
+create, update, and delete both buckets and objects.  These tools connect to one
+or more remote Moray servers over TCP and execute operations.
+.PP

+The tools in this package support two modes for locating the remote Moray server
+on which to operate:
+.RS
+.IP \(bu 2
+Using the \fB\fC\-S\fR/\fB\fC\-\-service SERVICE_NAME\fR option or the \fB\fCMORAY_SERVICE\fR
+environment variable, users specify a DNS domain to which SRV records are
+attached that describe the list of instances available.  SRV records provide
+both a name for the host (which may be an IP address or another DNS domain)
+and a port on which to connect over TCP.  This mode is preferred for
+general use because it provides information about all instances and allows the
+client to balance multiple requests across different, equivalent servers.
+.IP \(bu 2
+Using the \fB\fC\-h\fR/\fB\fC\-\-host HOST_OR_IP\fR and \fB\fC\-p\fR/\fB\fC\-\-port PORT\fR options or the
+\fB\fCMORAY_URL\fR environment variable, users specify a specific IP address or DNS
+domain to which traditional name records are attached and a TCP port to which
+to connect.  This is useful primarily for testing against specific server
+instances.
+.RE
+.PP
+If the \fB\fC\-S\fR/\fB\fC\-\-service SERVICE_NAME\fR command\-line option is specified, it is
+always used directly as described above.
+.PP
+If the \fB\fC\-h\fR/\fB\fC\-\-host HOST_OR_IP\fR or \fB\fC\-p\fR/\fB\fC\-\-port PORT\fR options are specified,
+they are used directly as described above.  If one is specified and not the
+other, then the other value is filled in from the \fB\fCMORAY_URL\fR environment
+variable.  Otherwise, defaults of IP \fB\fC127.0.0.1\fR and port \fB\fC2020\fR are used.
+.PP
+If none of these command\-line options are specified:
+.RS
+.IP \(bu 2
+if \fB\fCMORAY_SERVICE\fR is specified, it is used to invoke the first mode
+.IP \(bu 2

+\fB\fC127.0.0.1\fR port \fB\fC2020\fR\&.
+.RE
+.SH OPTIONS
+.PP
+The following \fB\fCCOMMON_OPTIONS\fR options are accepted by all of these commands:
+.TP
+\fB\fC\-b, \-\-bootstrap\-domain BOOTSTRAP_DOMAIN\fR
+Specifies the domain name for the nameservers themselves.  Triton and Manta
+both provide domain names for the nameservers themselves.  This is useful in
+split DNS environments to ensure that the Moray only uses the nameservers
+that know about the target service.  This applies to both SRV\-record\-based
+discovery and traditional A\-record\-based discovery, but has no impact when
+connecting to a specific IP address and port.
+.TP
+\fB\fC\-h, \-\-host HOST_OR_IP\fR
+Specifies an IP address or DNS domain for the remote Moray server.  See
+above for details.

+remote Moray server.  See above for details.  \fB\fCSERVICE\fR must not be an IP
+address.
+.TP
+\fB\fC\-v, \-\-verbose\fR
+Increases the verbosity of the built\-in bunyan logger.  By default, the
+logger is created with bunyan level \fB\fCfatal\fR\&.  Each additional use of \fB\fC\-v\fR
+increases the verbosity by one level (to \fB\fCerror\fR, \fB\fCwarn\fR, and so on).  Log
+messages are emitted to stderr.  See also the \fB\fCLOG_LEVEL\fR environment
+variable.
+.SH ENVIRONMENT

+With most forms of service discovery (described in \fB\fCmoray(1)\fR), this request

+Old versions of Moray do not respond to the version request at all.  On such

+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.PP
+\fB\fCreindexobjects [COMMON_OPTIONS] BUCKET [COUNT]\fR
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.PP
+Reindexing is the process by which the internal representation of objects is
+updated to account for indexes that were added after the object was last
+written.  For example, if you add a new index to a bucket that already contains
+a million objects, it's necessary to examine the raw JSON value of each object,
+extract the value of the newly\-indexed field, and add that value to the index.
+Until this has been completed for all objects in the bucket, the index is
+incomplete, and it will not be used in queries with \fB\fCfindobjects\fR and related
+tools.  Because reindexing every object in the bucket can take quite a while,
+the server does not do it automatically when the index is created with
+\fB\fCputbucket(1)\fR\&.  Instead, users that add indexes must use the \fB\fCreindexobjects\fR
+command to reindex all the objects in a bucket.
+.PP
+\fB\fCreindexobjects\fR reindexes any objects in bucket \fB\fCBUCKET\fR that have not been
+reindexed since the last time an indexed field was added to the bucket (e.g.,
+using \fB\fCputbucket(1)\fR).  This operation performs as many queries as necessary,
+each reindexing up to \fB\fCCOUNT\fR objects (which defaults to 100).  The command
+stops either when all objects have been reindexed or when an error occurs.  This
+operation can take an arbitrarily long time on arbitrarily large buckets.
+.PP
+Reindexing is idempotent.  For each object, this operation updates all indexes
+that were created after the object was written.  If you add multiple indexed
+fields, even in multiple operations, you only need to reindex each object once.

+.TH sql 1 "December 2016" Moray "Moray Client Tools"
+.SH NAME
+.PP
+sql \- check of a Moray server is functioning
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.PP
+\fB\fCsql [COMMON_OPTIONS] SQL\fR
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.PP
+Executes a raw SQL command \fB\fCSQL\fR against Moray's backing data store.  This is
+intended for experienced operators and developers to run ad hoc queries (usually
+read\-only).  A mistake in the \fB\fCSQL\fR string can cause all manner of bad behavior,
+including database deadlock, data corruption, and data loss.  This tool and
+Moray perform almost no validation on the input string.
+.PP
+This should not be used as part of normal operation.  Normal operations should
+be first\-classed as specific Moray requests with associated tools.
+.SH OPTIONS
+.PP
+See \fB\fCmoray(1)\fR for information about the \fB\fCCOMMON_OPTIONS\fR, which control
+the log verbosity and how to locate the remote server.
+.SH ENVIRONMENT
+.PP
+See \fB\fCmoray(1)\fR for information about the \fB\fCLOG_LEVEL\fR, \fB\fCMORAY_SERVICE\fR, and
+\fB\fCMORAY_URL\fR environment variables.
+.SH EXAMPLES
+.SH SEE ALSO
+.PP
+\fB\fCmoray(1)\fR
+.SH BUGS
+.PP
+Moray removes newlines from all SQL commands that it executes, including those
+specified with this command.  The results can be surprising.  This most commonly
+affects SQL "\-\-" comments, which run to the end of the line.  Since newlines are
+stripped, everything after the first opening "\-\-" gets commented out.

+.TH updatemany 1 "December 2016" Moray "Moray Client Tools"
+.SH NAME
+.PP
+updatemany \- update multiple objects using a filter
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.PP
+\fB\fCupdatemany [COMMON_OPTIONS] [\-d DATA] [\-l LIMIT] BUCKET FILTER\fR
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.PP
+Updates objects from bucket \fB\fCBUCKET\fR whose properties match the filter \fB\fCFILTER\fR\&.
+\fB\fCDATA\fR is a JSON object describing what to update.  Properties of \fB\fCDATA\fR must be
+indexed fields.  For each matching row, the fields specified in \fB\fCDATA\fR will be
+updated to their corresponding values in \fB\fCDATA\fR\&.  Other fields are unchanged.
+.PP
+Like \fB\fCfindobjects\fR, \fB\fCupdatemany\fR operations are always bounded in size.  See the
+\fB\fC\-l LIMIT\fR option.  You must use multiple invocations to update arbitrarily
+large lists of objects.
+.PP
+\fB\fCFILTER\fR is an LDAP\-like filter string described in \fB\fCfindobjects(1)\fR\&.  The
+caveats described there around the use of unindexed fields apply to filters used
+with \fB\fCupdatemany\fR as well.
+.SH OPTIONS
+.TP
+\fB\fC\-d DATA\fR
+Specifies the fields to update in each matching object.
+.TP
+\fB\fC\-l LIMIT\fR
+Remove at most \fB\fCLIMIT\fR objects.  This interacts badly with filters on
+unindexed fields, as described in \fB\fCfindobjects(1)\fR\&.  If this option is
+unspecified, a default limit is provided (which is currently 1000).
+.PP
+See \fB\fCmoray(1)\fR for information about the \fB\fCCOMMON_OPTIONS\fR, which control
+the log verbosity and how to locate the remote server.
+.SH ENVIRONMENT
+.PP

+.TH moray 3 "December 2016" Moray "Moray Client Library"
+.SH NAME
+.PP
+moray \- Node.js client library for Moray
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.PP
+Moray is a JSON\-based key\-value store.  For an overview of Moray, see
+\fB\fCmoray(1)\fR\&.  This manual page assumes basic familiarity with the services Moray
+provides, how to use them from the command line, and how both SRV\-based service
+discovery and traditional service discovery work from the command line.
+.PP
+The \fB\fCmoray\fR npm package contains a Node.js client library that allows consumers
+to create, update, and delete both buckets and objects.  The package also
+contains a suite of command\-line tools for exercising these interfaces.  When in
+doubt, see the implementation of those tools for examples of using each RPC
+call.
+.SS Creating a client
+.PP
+To interact with Moray, users of the Node library instantiate a Moray client
+object, which requires a bunyan\-style logger.  The simplest invocation, which is
+suitable only for one\-off tools and test programs, would be to connect to Moray
+on localhost:
+.PP
+.RS
+.nf
+var mod_bunyan = require('bunyan');
+var mod_moray = require('moray');
+
+var log = mod_bunyan.createLogger({ name: 'my\-tool', level: 'INFO' });
+
+var client = mod_moray.createClient({
+    log: log,
+    host: '127.0.0.1',
+    port: 2020
+});
+
+client.on('connect', function () {
+    /* Start making RPC calls.  This example lists buckets. */
+    client.listBuckets(function (err, buckets) {
+        if (err) {
+            /* This should be handled more gracefully! */
+            throw (err);
+        }
+
+        console.log(JSON.stringify(buckets));
+
+        /* When finished, be sure to close the client. */
+        client.close();
+    });
+});
+.fi
+.RE
+.PP
+This works for a simple test program, but is not suitable for Triton and Manta
+servers or command\-line tools for a few reasons:
+.RS
+.IP \(bu 2
+This mode does not support SRV\-based service discovery, which is critical for
+increased scalability and improved fault tolerance.  SRV\-based discovery is
+configured by using the \fB\fCsrvDomain\fR property instead of \fB\fChost\fR or \fB\fCport.\fR
+.IP \(bu 2
+This mode does not enable the client to use bootstrap resolvers, which are
+critical for use in mixed DNS environments (e.g., where a combination of
+Triton, Manta, or external namservers may be in use).  Bootstrap resolvers are
+configured using the \fB\fCcueballOptions.resolvers\fR property.
+.IP \(bu 2
+Command\-line tools should generally specify additional parameters to ensure
+that they fail quickly when servers are down rather than retrying
+indefinitely until they are online.  This means specifying \fB\fCfailFast\fR\&.  It's
+also a good idea to specify \fB\fCmustCloseBeforeNormalProcessExit\fR to make sure
+that your tool shuts down cleanly.
+.RE
+.PP
+Here's a general pattern for \fIserver\fP components in Triton and Manta to
+configure the Moray client:
+.PP
+.RS
+.nf
+var mod_jsprim = require('jsprim');
+
+var client, config;
+
+/*
+ * Extract the Moray client configuration block from the server's
+ * configuration file.  Here, we assume that "serverConfig" came from
+ * parsing the server's configuration file.  We also assume that the
+ * Moray configuration property is just called "moray", but some components
+ * (notably Muskie) have multiple clients, and they would use different
+ * property names (e.g., "picker" or "marlin").
+ */
+config = jsprim.deepCopy(serverConfig.moray);
+config.log = log;
+client = mod_moray.createClient(config);
+client.on('connect', function onMorayConnect() {
+    /* start using the client */
+});
+.fi
+.RE
+.PP
+\fIClient\fP components would usually add an \fB\fCerror\fR listener, too:
+.PP
+.RS
+.nf
+/*
+ * Client tools add an error listener.  Servers generally should NOT do this
+ * because they configure the client to retry indefinitely.  Any errors
+ * emitted by the client would be programmer errors.
+ */
+client.on('error', function onError(err) {
+    console.error('moray client error: %s', err.message);
+    process.exit(1);
+});
+.fi
+.RE
+.PP
+In practice, \fB\fCserverConfig.moray\fR comes from a SAPI configuration template.  For
+\fBTriton services\fP, it will typically look like this:
+.PP
+.RS
+.nf
+{
+    "srvDomain": "{{{MORAY_SERVICE}}}"
+    "cueballOptions": {
+        "resolvers": [ "{{{BINDER_SERVICE}}}" ]
+    }
+}
+.fi
+.RE
+.PP
+That will expand to something like this:
+.PP
+.RS
+.nf
+{
+    "srvDomain": "moray.mydatacenter.joyent.us",
+    "cueballOptions": {
+        "resolvers": [ "binder.mydatacenter.joyent.us" ]
+    }
+}
+.fi
+.RE
+.PP
+For \fBManta services\fP, the template file will typically include a block that
+looks like this:
+.PP
+.RS
+.nf
+{
+    "srvDomain": "{{MARLIN_MORAY_SHARD}}",
+    "cueballOptions": {
+        "resolvers": [ "nameservice.{{DOMAIN_NAME}}" ]
+    }
+}
+.fi
+.RE
+.PP
+That will expand to something like this:
+.PP
+.RS
+.nf
+{
+    "srvDomain": "1.moray.myregion.joyent.us",
+    "cueballOptions": {
+        "resolvers": [ "nameservice.myregion.joyent.us" ]
+    }
+}
+.fi
+.RE
+.PP
+This approach (using a block from the configuration file) allows operators to
+reconfigure a service to point at a specific instance by replacing the
+\fB\fCsrvDomain\fR property with \fB\fChost\fR and \fB\fCport\fR properties.
+.PP
+Command\-line tools that use Moray should typically define their own options for
+specifying \fB\fCsrvDomain\fR, \fB\fChost\fR, and \fB\fCport\fR properties.  See \fB\fCmoray(1)\fR for the
+command\-line options and fallback environment variables used by the built\-in
+Moray tools.
+.PP
+Command\-line tools should generally also specify \fB\fCfailFast\fR and
+\fB\fCmustCloseBeforeNormalProcessExit\fR\&.
+.SS Making RPC calls
+.PP
+Callers make RPC calls by invoking RPC methods on the client.  The specific
+methods are documented in the Moray server \[la]https://github.com/joyent/moray\[ra]
+reference documentation.
+.PP
+All RPC methods are asynchronous, and they all follow one of two styles
+described in the "Node.js Error Handling" documentat.  The style used depends on
+the kind of data returned by the RPC.
+.RS
+.IP \(bu 2
+RPC calls that return a fixed number of results (usually just one object or a
+small chunk of metadata) are callback\-based: the last argument to the RPC
+method is a callback.  The first argument to the callback is an optional
+error, and subsequent arguments are RPC\-specific.
+.IP \(bu 2
+RPC calls that return a large or variable number of results (like
+\fB\fCfindObjects\fR) are event\-emitter\-based: they return an event emitter that
+emits \fB\fCerror\fR on failure, \fB\fCend\fR on completion, and other events depending on
+the RPC call.
+.RE
+.PP
+All of the RPC methods take an optional \fB\fCoptions\fR argument that is always the
+last non\-callback argument.  (For callback\-based RPCs, it's the second\-to\-last
+argument.  For event\-emitter\-based RPCs, it's the last argument.)  You can use
+this to pass in a \fB\fCreq_id\fR for correlating log entries from one service with
+the Moray client log entries.  Some APIs (namely put/get/del object) have
+additional options to allow cache bypassing, for example.
+.SH OPTIONS
+.PP
+The client constructor uses named arguments on a single \fB\fCargs\fR object.
+.PP
+All constructor invocations must provide:
+.TP
+\fB\fClog\fR (object)
+a bunyan\-style logger
+.PP
+All constructor invocations must also provide one of the following:
+.TP
+\fB\fCsrvDomain\fR (string)
+DNS domain name for SRV\-based service discovery
+.TP
+\fB\fCurl\fR (string)
+Describes the hostname or IP address and TCP port to specify a specific
+Moray server to connect to (instead of using SRV\-based service discovery).
+This is deprecated for servers, and should only be used for tools, for
+testing, and for unusual, temporary operational changes.  The format for
+this option is the same as for the \fB\fCMORAY_URL\fR environment variable
+described in \fB\fCmoray(1)\fR\&.
+.TP
+\fB\fChost\fR (string) and \fB\fCport\fR (integer or string)
+Like \fB\fCURL\fR, but specified using different properties.
+.PP
+Callers may also provide:
+.TP
+\fB\fCcueballOptions\fR (object)
+Overrides cueball\-related options, including various timeouts and delays.
+For specific options that can be overridden here, see the source.  \fBNOTE:
+it's not expected that most consumers would need to specify any of these.
+Default values ought to work for the port, DNS service, and all the various
+timeouts, delays, and retry limits.\fP
+.TP
+\fB\fCfailFast\fR (boolean)
+If true, this sets a more aggressive retry policy, and the client emits
+"error" when the underlying Cueball set reaches state "failed".  This is
+intended for use by command\-line tools to abort when it looks like dependent
+servers are down.  Servers should generally not specify this option because
+they should wait indefinitely for dependent services to come up.
+.TP
+\fB\fCunwrapErrors\fR (boolean)
+If false (the default), Errors emitted by this client and RPC requests will
+contain a cause chain that explains precisely what happened.  For example,
+if an RPC fails with SomeError, you'll get back a FastRequestError
+(indicating a request failure) caused by a FastServerError (indicating that
+the failure was on the remote server, as opposed to a local or
+transport\-level failure) caused by a SomeError.  In this mode, you should
+use VError.findCauseByName(err, 'SomeError') to determine whether the root
+cause was a SomeError.
+If the "unwrapErrors" option is true, then Fast\-level errors are unwrapped
+and the first non\-Fast error in the cause chain is returned.  This is
+provided primarily for compatibility with legacy code that uses err.name to
+determine what kind of Error was returned.  New code should prefer
+VError.findCauseByName() instead.
+.TP
+\fB\fCmustCloseBeforeNormalProcessExit\fR (boolean)
+If true, then cause the program to crash if it would otherwise exit 0 and
+this client has not been closed.  This is useful for making sure that client
+consumers clean up after themselves.
+.PP
+Some legacy options are accepted as documented in the source.
+.SH ENVIRONMENT
+.PP
+The \fB\fCLOG_LEVEL\fR, \fB\fCMORAY_SERVICE\fR, and \fB\fCMORAY_URL\fR environment variables are
+interpreted by each command\-line tool, not the client library itself.
+.SH SEE ALSO
+.PP
+\fB\fCmoray(1)\fR, Moray server reference documentation, Node.js Error Handling
+.SH DIAGNOSTICS
+.PP
+The client library logs messages using the bunyan logger.  Increase the log
+level for more verbose output.
+.PP
+The underlying node\-fast \[la]https://github.com/joyent/node-fast\[ra] RPC library
+provides DTrace probes on supported systems for inspecting low\-level RPC events.
+.PP
+Use Node's \fB\fC\-\-abort\-on\-uncaught\-exception\fR command\-line argument to enable core
+file generation upon fatal program failure.  These core files can be used with
+mdb_v8 \[la]https://github.com/joyent/mdb_v8\[ra] to inspect the program's state at the
+time of the crash.

+#
+
+#
+# This Makefile is used along with Makefile.manpages.targ to build section
+# manpages for the current repository from Markdown sources using the md2man
+# tool.  You can build several different sections of manpages with this
+# Makefile, but you'll need to include the Makefile once for each section with a
+# different value of MAN_SECTION.  Required input variables include:
+#
+#     MAN_SECTION	defines which section's manpages will be built
+#     			(e.g., "1")
+#
+#     MAN_INROOT	defines the root of a directory tree containing man
+#     			pages source files in Markdown format.  The directory
+#     			tree should be organized as:
+#
+#     			    $(MAN_INROOT)/man$(MAN_SECTION)/*.md
+#
+#     MAN_OUTROOT	defines the root of a directory tree that will contain
+#     			the generated man pages.  The directory tree will be
+#     			organized as:
+#
+#     			    $(MAN_OUTROOT)/man$(MAN_SECTION)/*.$(MAN_SECTION)
+#
+#			This should mirror the typical man page directory
+#			structure, and should probably be alongside a
+#			corresponding "bin" directory to leverage the way
+#			man(1)'s looks up man pages for binaries.
+#
+# A common configuration would be to set MAN_INROOT = "docs/man" and
+# MAN_OUTROOT = "man".  In that case, you might have source files:
+#
+#     ./bin/mytool
+#     ./bin/my-other-tool
+#     ./docs/man/man1/mytool.md
+#     ./docs/man/man1/my-other-tool.md
+#
+# and that will generate files:
+#
+#     ./man/man1/mytool.1
+#     ./man/man1/my-other-tool.1
+#
+# Optional input variables include:
+#
+#     MD2MAN		tool to generate man pages from Markdown sources
+#     			The recommended tool is md2man-roff, available at
+#     			https://github.com/sunaku/md2man.
+#
+#     MKDIRP		should generally be "mkdir -p"
+#
+# This Makefile produces Make variables:
+#
+#     MAN_$(MAN_SECTION)_OUTPUTS	generated manual pages.  You can depend
+#     					on these in order to build them in
+#     					whatever top-level targets you want.
+#
+#     MAN_OUTPUTS			will be extended to include
+#     					MAN_$(MAN_SECTION)_OUTPUTS.
+#
+# There are two basic ways this tends to be used:
+#
+#     (1) Building manpages is part of the normal build.  Have the default
+#         target (usually "all") depends on either "manpages" or the built man
+#         pages directly (via MAN_OUTPAGES).  In this case, only the man pages
+#         _sources_ would be checked into source control.
+#
+#     (2) Building manpages is an ad-hoc operation outside the normal build
+#         process.  Developers that change the man page sources are expected to
+#         build the man pages and commit the generated pages into source
+#         control.
+#
+# Option (1) is preferred, since option (2) violates the basic tenets of
+# software engineering that processes should generally be automated and that
+# generated files should not be checked into source control.  The problem is
+# that in practice, the tools that we use to generate man pages are not widely
+# installed on most users' systems, even developers' systems, so it's less than
+# ideal to require them for the main build.  This is especially true for many of
+# our Node modules, where there's traditionally no difference between the
+# published npm package and the repository source itself.  As a result, we use
+# option (2) in most places.  However, this Makefile supports both modes.
