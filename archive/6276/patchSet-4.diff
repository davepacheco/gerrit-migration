+title: Electric Moray: Joyent's Sharded Key/Value Store.
+markdown2extras: tables, code-friendly
+apisections: Buckets, Objects, Tokens
+---
+
+# Electric Moray
+
+This is the reference documentation for Electric Moray, which provides an
+abstraction over multiple [Moray][MS] shards so that objects can be
+mostly evenly distributed throughout them based on their key.
+
+Electric Moray does this by using pre-defined [key transformations][KT] and
+a consistent hash (created and managed using [node-fash][NF]) to map objects
+onto the service's backend shards.
+
+Electric Moray provides the same interface as Moray, but with some
+exceptions. This document will explain where the API diverges, and
+what users may need to do differently. For basic Moray usage, see its
+[API documentation](https://github.com/joyent/moray/blob/master/docs/index.md).
+
+Clients connect to Electric Moray with the same [Moray client][MC] that they
+would use to talk to a Moray server, just using an address that corresponds to
+an Electric Moray instance instead.
+
+# Buckets
+
+When working with buckets, [CreateBucket][CB], [UpdateBucket][UB], and
+[DeleteBucket][DB] will be run on every one of the backing shards. If the
+command fails on any of the shards, then a `MultiError` will be returned
+containing each of the failures. It is up to the consumer to run the command
+repeatedly until each of the shards is in a consistent state. This means that
+the call must return no error, indicating that it succeeded on all shards, or:
+
+- CreateBucket needs to be repeated until it returns `BucketConflictError` for
+  all shards so that the client knows it already exists on every node
+- UpdateBucket needs to eventually return no errors (when not using versioned
+  buckets) or the same `BucketVersionError` for all shards (when using versioned
+  buckets)
+- DeleteBucket needs to return `BucketNotFoundError` for all shards
+
+For information on inputs to each of these RPCs, see the section of the Moray
+documentation on [Buckets][BK].
+
+## GetBucket
+
+GetBucket behaves the same in Electric Moray as it does in Moray. It gets run on
+a random shard with the expectation that the consumer has taken care to ensure
+the bucket configuration is the same on each shard.
+
+See the [GetBucket][GB] section of the Moray documentation for more.
+
+## ListBuckets
+
+ListBuckets is currently not an implemented RPC in Electric Moray. Attempts to
+use it will hang on older Electric Morays, due to [MORAY-336][M336].
+
+# Objects
+
+PutObject, GetObject and DeleteObject all behave the same in Electric Moray,
+and will be forwarded to one of the backing shards depending on the hashing of
+the given key. Note that Electric Moray attempts to transform the key before
+hashing it for some buckets:
+
+- Keys for the `manta` bucket, which are Manta paths, get transformed into the
+  directory name for the path to ensure that sibling objects end up on the
+  same backing shard.
+- Keys for the `manta_uploads` bucket, which are of the form
+  `<Upload ID>:<Manta path>`, extract the directory name of the path component
+  so that multipart upload information ends up on the same shard as the object
+  being created.
+
+If the bucket has no transformation defined, then the behaviour is undefined.
+
+See the Moray documentation for [PutObject][PO], [GetObject][GO], and
+[DeleteObject][DO].
+
+## FindObjects
+
+FindObjects behaves the same as the [RPCs described above](#objects), but
+requires being told which shard it needs to operate on by exactly one of the
+`hashkey` or `token` parameters in the `options` object.
+
+See the [FindObjects][FO] section of the Moray documentation for more.
+
+### Additional Options
+
+| Field   | Type   | Description                                                                      |
+| ------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
+| hashkey | string | a value to hash to choose a backing shard (e.g., a directory name for `'manta'`) |
+| token   | string | a token returned from [GetTokens](#gettokens) referencing a shard                |
+
+## UpdateObjects
+
+UpdateObjects is not supported by Electric Moray since the filter could require
+updating objects on multiple shards.
+
+## DeleteMany
+
+DeleteMany is not supported by Electric Moray since the filter could require
+deleting objects on multiple shards.
+
+## ReindexObjects
+
+ReindexObjects is currently not an implemented RPC in Electric Moray. Attempts
+to use it will hang on older Electric Morays, due to [MORAY-336][M336].
+
+## Batch
+
+Batch is supported in Electric Moray, but in a limited fashion to ensure that
+only objects living on the same shard are affected. This means that only the
+operations `'put'` and `'delete'` can be used in the array of batch requests
+given to Electric Moray. For each request in the array, their `'key'` fields
+must transform to the same value.
+
+See the [Batch][BA] section of the Moray documentation for more.
+
+### API
+
+    var req_id = mod_uuid.v4();
+    var requests = [
+        {
+            operation: 'put',
+            bucket: 'accounts',
+            key: 'jsmith',
+            options: { etag: null },
+            value: {
+                "email": "john.smith@example.com",
+                "uuid": "e53ec812-a41a-6704-e5db-b18264995957"
+            }
+        },
+        {
+            operation: 'delete',
+            bucket: 'accounts_pending',
+            key: 'jsmith',
+            options: { etag: 'E0805A8F' }
+        }
+    ];
+
+    client.batch(requests, { req_id: req_id }, function (err, res) {
+        mod_assert.ifError(err);
+        console.log('etags: %j', res.etags);
+    });
+
+# Other
+
+## sql
+
+Every shard will be sent the same SQL and their results will be merged into a
+single stream. As with regular Moray, this operation should only be used for
+debugging.
+
+See the [sql][SQ] section of the Moray documentation for more.
+
+### Additional Options
+
+| Field            | Type    | Description                                                                                                    |
+| ---------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
+| readOnlyOverride | boolean | whether to override and ignore the safety guards that prevent using this RPC when the ring is marked read-only |
+
+#### Additional Errors
+
+* `ReadOnlyError`
+
+### CLI
+
+    $ sql 'select random();'
+    {
+      "random": 0.334264599718153
+    }
+    {
+      "random": 0.730934096500278
+    }
+
+# Tokens
+
+Electric Moray's API has a concept of "tokens", which are strings that represent
+a shard. They are mostly useful for operators and developers looking to get
+information from an Electric Moray since consumers should normally be unaware
+of the individual backing Moray shards.
+
+## GetTokens
+
+GetTokens returns an array of tokens for each of the Electric Moray's shards.
+
+### API
+
+    client.getTokens(function (err, res) {
+        assert.ifError(err);
+        console.log('tokens: %j', res.tokens);
+    });
+
+### Inputs
+
+| Field   | Type   | Description                                            |
+| ------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
+| options | object | any optional parameters (req\_id)                      |
+
+### CLI
+
+    $ gettokens
+    {
+      "tokens": [
+        "tcp://1.moray.emy-7.joyent.us:2020",
+        "tcp://2.moray.emy-7.joyent.us:2020"
+      ]
+    }
