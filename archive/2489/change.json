It\u0027s unclear what the proper way to expose it would be, especially when it comes to logic which sums up segment sizes to derive a virtual size for the AS.\n\nIt did seem prudent to make the hole visible to ::pmap, which has been done.\n\n\nRegarding the changes to the AS diagrams in uts/*/os/startup.c, I have mixed feelings.  The focus on those seems to be mostly about the kernel-related regions of the AS.
