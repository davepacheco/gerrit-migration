I\u0027ve also removed the `tr` command because it causes a\nsuperfluous \u0027%\u0027 sign to be appended to the output on MacOS. This command\nwill unlikely be used in another shell script, and therefore shouldn\u0027t\nbe an issue.\n","createdOn":1471877871,"lastUpdated":1474392467,"open":false,"status":"ABANDONED","comments":[{"timestamp":1471877871,"reviewer":{"name":"Cal Leeming","email":"cal@iops.io","username":"foxx"},"message":"Uploaded patch set 1."},{"timestamp":1471877897,"reviewer":{"name":"Joyent Automation","username":"joyent-automation"},"message":"Patch Set 1: CI-Testing+1\n\n\"make check\" passed ok"},{"timestamp":1471888740,"reviewer":{"name":"Trent Mick","email":"trentm@gmail.com","username":"trentm"},"message":"Patch Set 1:\n\nnote to self: this is https://github.com/joyent/node-smartdc/pull/77"},{"timestamp":1474310289,"reviewer":{"name":"Trent Mick","email":"trentm@gmail.com","username":"trentm"},"message":"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1\n\nCal,\n\nThanks for this change.
