+# amon currently builds against 32-bit 0.8.x nodejs and depends on old versions
+# of the node-dtrace-provider with a bug that prevents compiling for 32-bit if
+# the *host* is x86_64 (as components do when they include the amon agent).  All
+# fixed versions of node-trace-provider require nodejs >= 0.10.  However,
+# multiple libraries used by amon (zutil, zsock) require nodejs <= 0.8.  This
+# gcc wrapper forces the 32-bit target, effectively inlining the
+# node-trace-provider fix.  This hack should be removed if amon is every updated
+# past nodejs 0.8.  See also TRITON-1658
+#
+# NOTE: This PATH definition must appear before node_prebuilt, which also mucks
+# with PATH.
