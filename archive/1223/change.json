I meant to mention that this wasn\u0027t fully polished yet, though I think besides the XXX\u0027s, it\u0027s close to ready, so hopefully there will be little delta when it comes time for final review.\n\nI\u0027ve pushed a patchset (patch set 2) that I believe addresses all of your feedback except for this one:\n\n\u003e The descriptions of flags and options throughout the Markdown files are indented by 4 spaces, but md2man seems to generate bad troff for them and they end up wrapping poorly. Adjusting them locally to being indented by 2 spaces in the Markdown corrected the output (and they appeared indented by 8 spaces in the manual page).\n\nThis was my mistake.  I will fix them in the next patchset (patch set 3).\n\n\u003e Is there a reason to check in the generated roff? It seems like it should always be generated locally before being published to npm\n\nThere\u0027s a note about this in the Makefile above the target that generates the manual pages, though that basically refers to the discussion in Makefile.manpages.defs.  The summary is that yes, it would be preferable to build them at runtime.  Unfortunately, the tool we use to generate them is a bit of a pain to install, so we\u0027ve been somewhat reluctant to require it as part of regular builds of client tools that might be used by a wide group."},{"timestamp":1484173960,"reviewer":{"name":"David Pacheco","email":"dap@joyent.com","username":"davepacheco"},"message":"Patch Set 1:\n\n(1
