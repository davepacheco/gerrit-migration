-# Set Up CoaL
+# Cloud on a Laptop (CoaL)
 
-CoaL stands for "Cloud on a Laptop". It is a VMware virtual appliance
-for a SmartDataCenter headnode. It's useful for developing and testing
-SmartDataCenter (SDC). This document walks through setting up CoaL.
+CoaL is a VMware appliance that is a full (Triton)[https://docs.joyent.com/private-cloud) head node for development and testing. Because most Joyent developers work on Macs, this document walks through the process of setting up CoaL on a Mac. Read this document carefully before installing CoaL.
 
-**WARNING: these steps and command options are not appropriate for
-production deployments.**
+**Note**: Developers in the community have set up CoaL successfully on Windows and on Linux using these instructions as general guidelines, modifying them as needed.
 
-The minimum requirements, practically speaking, for a good CoaL
-experience is a **Mac with at least 16 GB RAM and an SSD with at least
-45 GB disk available**. Currently, almost all team members using CoaL
-are on Macs with VMware Fusion. Vmware Workstation for Linux is used by
-a few in the community. VMware Workstation for Windows should work, but
-has not recently been tested.
+**WARNING**: The installation procedure and configuration options in this document are not appropriate for production deployments.
 
-At a high level, setting up CoaL involves:
 
-1. Downloading the latest build.
-1. Booting the VMware appliance (virtual machine).
-2. Configuring SmartDataCenter.
-3. Waiting for the SDC services to automatically install and setup in
-   the SDC headnode virtual machine. This can take from 10 to 20 minutes
-   on a Mac laptop.
-4. Test and develop.
+## Minimum Requirements
 
+The minimum requirements for a good CoaL experience are a Mac with  16 GB RAM and an SSD with 45 GB disk available.
 
-## Run CoaL on VMware
+## Overview
 
-### Download CoaL and Configure VMware
+The high-level steps for setting up CoaL are:
 
-1. Start the download of the latest CoaL build. The tarball is
-   approximately 2 GB.
+1. Downloading the latest CoaL build.
+2. Downloading, installing, and configuring VMware.
+3. Extracting and loading CoaL.
+4. Booting the VMware appliance (virtual machine).
+5. Configuring the head node.
+6. Installing Triton (10 to 20 minutes).
+7. Testing and developing.
 
-    curl -C - -O https://us-east.manta.joyent.com/Joyent_Dev/public/SmartDataCenter/coal-latest.tgz
+## Downloading CoaL
 
-2. Install VMware, if you haven't already.
-    - Mac: [VMware Fusion](http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion) 5, 7, or 8.
-    - Windows or Linux: [VMware Workstation](http://www.vmware.com/products/workstation).
+The CoaL tarball is approximately 2 GB and will take some time to download.
 
-3. Configure VMware virtual networks for CoaL's "external" and "admin"
-   networks. This is a one time configuration for a VMware installation.
+To download the latest CoaL build:
 
-    1. Launch VMware at least once after installing VMware.
+	```
+	curl -C - -O https://us-east.manta.joyent.com/Joyent_Dev/public/SmartDataCenter/release-20180927-20180927T130527Z/headnode/coal-release-20180927-20180927T130527Z-g34dbd8a-4gb.tgz
+	```
 
-    2. Run the OS specific CoaL set up script for VMware:
+While you wait for the tarball download to complete, you can configure and install VMware.
 
-         - Mac:
+## Downloading installing, and configuring VMware

-1. Set memory and run.
+2. To load the CoaL appliance:
+    1. Launch **VMware Fusion**.
+    2. Select **File** and then click **Open**.
+    3. Navigate to and select the `.vmwarevm` file that contains the CoaL build.
 
-    - Mac example:
+**Note**: If you are working from the command line instead of the VMware GUI, run:
 
-        1. Launch VMware Fusion
-        2. File > Open... `coal-<branch>-<build_date_time>-<git_sha1_hash>-4gb.vmwarevm`
-        3. Virtual Machine > Settings
-        4. Processes & Memory > Default memory is set to 8192 MB, but be sure
-	   to leave Mac OS X with at least 8 GB.  If you prefer not to use the
-	   VMWare GUI, the place to change this default is in the CoaL
-	   `USB-headnode.vmx` file, where you can set `memsize = "6144"`, for
-	   example.
-	   WARNING: If you choose to allocate less than 6 GB this may cause
-	   problems, and if you go as low as 4 GB it certainly will. As the
-	   CoaL VM hits its memory limit, it will page rapidly and operations
-	   will contend for resources.  In this situation, the VM will attempt
-	   to perform massive amounts of disk I/O to keep up with the system's
-	   demands, and will slow down and eventually fail to meet them.
+	```
+	open coal-<branch>-<build_date_time>-<git_sha1_hash>-4gb.vmwarevm
+	```
 
-1. When you are prompted with the GRUB menu press the down arrow.

-     forgotten to redirect the console, see instructions above.
+1. Press the down arrow key to highlight **Live 64-bit**.
+2. Quickly press **c** to load the GRUB command line.
+	If you miss this step, press **Esc** to redirect the console back to the GRUB menu and try again.
+3. At the **GRUB command prompt**, type `variable os_console vga`, and press **Enter**.
+4. Press **Esc** to return to the GRUB menu.
+5. Press **Enter** to boot **Live 64-bit**.
+
+**Note**: If you see a blank screen with a cursor at the top left while the head node is booting, you may have forgotten to redirect the console. If so, press Esc to return to the GRUB menu.
