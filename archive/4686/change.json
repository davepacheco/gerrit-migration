Someone else may want to output by using snprintf/asprintf to a shared buffer and going from there.

If we had another program that wanted to use this library, it\u0027s not clear to me that it would want to use the same output.\n\nNow, another thing to ask is should we have an interface that takes apart the combined id automatically.
