+# Hadoop FileSystem Driver
+
+Hadoop can natively access Manta over the network. Most major Hadoop FileSystem
+features are supported. This is a community driven project, so updates to it 
+are dependent upon community involvement. The driver is available as a 
+stand-alone jar file that can be dropped into a Hadoop or Apache Drill 
+installation.
+
+You can download the jar directory from the [releases page](https://github.com/joyent/hadoop-manta/releases) 
+on the [project's github page](https://github.com/joyent/hadoop-manta) 
+or directly from Maven Central.
