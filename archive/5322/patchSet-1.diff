    Recently, watched the doc you made for the coal-setup, its quite meticulous.  Followed the doc to set it up again on my virtual machine since i needed coal setup there on my linux vm, it was pretty thorough. There aren't any other changes necessary to it, unless another new developer comes in and tries it for himself/herself.
