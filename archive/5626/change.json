Could you add these new testing notes to the ticket comments (including a note that you the test suite successfully)? One thing I forgot to mention before is to make sure the change is `make check` clean in addition to the test suite. Another option would be to run `make prepush`, which runs `make check` and the test suite again. Since you already ran the test suite, `make check` is sufficient.\n\nI think the 7 second requests make sense given that the timeout for a shark reply is 2 seconds (https://github.com/joyent/manta-muskie/blob/3b57299bb0edf3ce6e101530cf189df9de34d154/lib/shark_client.js#L207) and muskie will retry 3 times. So when muskie tries the shark that is down first, we would expect at least 6 seconds of latency from those retries. I\u0027m not sure where 3 seconds comes in. Perhaps those are requests where the shark that is receiving traffic is first?\n\nOnce you add the testing notes to the ticket, I will add IA approval :)"},{"timestamp":1553610108,"reviewer":{"name":"Russell Brown","email":"russell.brown@joyent.com","username":"russelldb"},"message":"Patch Set 6:\n\n\u003e \u003e Ok.
