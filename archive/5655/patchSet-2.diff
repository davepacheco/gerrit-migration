-	 * In the MorayDeleteRecordCleaner, Moray#batch may fail a potentially
-	 * large group of delete operations if one of those operations is to
-	 * delete a key that doesn't exist in the delete queue. For this reason,
-	 * we must make sure that no component of the garbage-collector attempts
-	 * requests deletion of the same key twice. This shared status object
-	 * determines whether the MakoInstructionUploader has already requested
-	 * that a record for some key be removed.
+	 * The DeleteRecordTransformer emits a separate instruction for each
+	 * storage node the object referred to by the record's key is stored on.
+	 * Since the metadata record occupies a single row in the metadata tier,
+	 * we use this bit of state to ensure that the key is included in only
+	 * one batch delete.
+	 *
+	 * A Moray batch delete could fail a potentially large number of
+	 * requests if any given delete transaction fails, so not doing this
+	 * opens the collector up to potentially wasting a lot of work.
