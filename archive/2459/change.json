I have one question on the Makefile, which is about the LEVELDB_TEST_ALGORITHM variable assignment.

My understanding is that each command in the recipe is executed in its own child process, which returns when it\u0027s done -- so the variables inside it cannot be referenced by other commands in the recipe.  For this reason, I wanted to make it a prerequisite rather than a part of the recipe.  Does that make sense?
