+
+#### Options
+
+##### limit
+
+A number that limits the number of records that are processed by the request.
+Default is `1000`, unless `noLimit` is set to `true`.
+
+##### noBucketCache
+
+A boolean which, when set to `true`, makes Moray refresh its bucket cache before
+handling the request. Default is `false`.
+
+##### no_count
+
+A boolean which, when set to `true`, makes Moray not include a `_count` property
+on each record sent with the response. Default is `false`.
+
+##### noLimit
+
+A boolean which, when set to `true` and `limit` is not set, makes Moray not have
+a maximum number of records processed by the request. Default is `false`.
+
+##### offset
+
+A number which indicates the offset at which Moray starts processing records
+that would be returned by the same request with no `offset`. Default is `0`.
+
+##### req_id
+
+A string that can be used to track a request. Default is an automatically
+generated V4 UUID.
+
+##### sort
+
+An object or an array of objects with the following properties:
+
+* `attribute`: a required property of type string representing a field name on
+  which to sort the result
+
+* `order`: an optional property of type string that is either `ASC` or `DESC` to
+  sort with ascending or descending order respectively. Default value is `ASC`.
+
+Default value is `undefined`.
+
+##### sql_only
+
+A boolean which, if `true`, makes Moray send the SQL statement that would be
+executed in the response instead of sending actual data records. Default is
+`false`.
+
+##### timeout
+
+A number that represents the delay in milliseconds that the request waits on a
+reply from its underlying Postgres query before it errors with a
+`QueryTimeoutError`. Default is `30000` (30 seconds).
