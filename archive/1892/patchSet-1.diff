+
+#### Options
+
+##### limit
+
+A number that limits the number of records that are processed by the request.
+Default is `1000`, unless `noLimit` is set to `true`.
+
+##### noBucketCache
+
+A boolean which, when set to `true`, makes moray refresh its bucket cache before
+handling the request. Default is `false`.
+
+##### no_count
+
+A boolean which, when set to `true`, makes moray not include a `_count` property
+on each record sent with the response. Default is `false`.
+
+##### noLimit
+
+A boolean which, when set to `true` and `limit` is not set, makes moray not have
+a maximum number of records processed by the request. Default is `false`.
+
+##### offset
+
+A number which indicates the offset at which moray starts processing records
+that would be returned by the same request with no `offset`. Default is `0`.
+
+##### req_id
+
+A string that can be used to track a request. Default is an automatically
+generated V4 UUID.
+
+##### sort
+
+An array of field names that determines how the result set is sorted. Default is
+[].
+
+##### sql_only
+
+A boolean which, if `true`, makes moray send the SQL statement that would be
+executed in the response instead of sending actual data records. Default is
+`false`.
+
+##### timeout
+
+A number that represents the delay in milliseconds before a request errors with
+a time out error. Default is `undefined`, and the request does not time out.
