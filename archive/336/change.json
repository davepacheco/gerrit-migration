In particular, the \"make check\" bot quite deliberately does not have *any* credentials on it (since it can be made to run arbitrary code in a CR), so it will -1 any changes to a repo that is using SSH URLs for submodules.\n\ngit:// URLs are undesirable because they operate without any TLS or encryption and have no way to authenticate the *server* (so they can be hijacked by malicious wifi hotspots and other such things).\n\nI\u0027d be on board with updating the eng guide to reflect that https:// URLs for submodules and git npm deps is the best practice and why."},{"timestamp":1471992659,"reviewer":{"name":"David Pacheco","email":"dap@joyent.com","username":"davepacheco"},"message":"Patch Set 3:\n\nThat sounds great.
