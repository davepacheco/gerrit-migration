+# Manta Contribution Guidelines
+
+The Manta project uses [cr.joyent.us](https://cr.joyent.us) for code review of
+all changes.  Any registered GitHub user can submit changes through this system.
+If you want to contribute a change, please see the [cr.joyent.us user
+guide](https://github.com/joyent/joyent-gerrit/blob/master/docs/user/README.md).
+If you're making a substantial change, you probably want to contact developers
+on the mailing list or IRC first.  If you have any trouble with the contribution
+process, please feel free to contact developers [on the mailing list or
+IRC](README.md#community).
+
+See the (work-in-progress) [developer guide](docs/dev-notes.md) for useful
+information about building and testing the software.
+
+Manta repositories use the same [Joyent Engineering
+Guidelines](https://github.com/joyent/eng/blob/master/docs/index.md) as
+the SDC project.  Notably:
+
+* The #master branch should be first-customer-ship (FCS) quality at all times.
+  Don't push anything until it's tested.
+* All repositories should be "make check" clean at all times.
+* All repositories should have tests that run cleanly at all times.
+
+"make check" checks both JavaScript style and lint.  Style is checked with
+[jsstyle](https://github.com/davepacheco/jsstyle).  The specific style rules are
+somewhat repo-specific.  See the jsstyle configuration file in each repo for
+exceptions to the default jsstyle rules.
+
+Lint is checked with
+[javascriptlint](https://github.com/davepacheco/javascriptlint).  ([Don't
+conflate lint with
+style!](http://dtrace.org/blogs/dap/2011/08/23/javascriptlint/)  There are gray
+areas, but generally speaking, style rules are arbitrary, while lint warnings
+identify potentially broken code.)  Repos sometimes have repo-specific lint
+rules, but this is less common.
