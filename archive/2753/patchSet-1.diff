 # Debugging: general tasks
 
-## Locating systems
+## Locating servers
 
-Each physical server has several unique identifers: the server UUID, the
-hostname, the manta compute id, and the manta storage id.  It also has a
-hardware configuration type (Shrimp, Richmond, Tenderloin, etc), a global zone
-IP, and a service processor IP.  Most of these are available from the "manta-adm
-cn" command.
+All Triton compute nodes have at least two unique identifiers:
 
-As an example, to fetch the server uuid and global zone IP for RM08218, use:
+- the server UUID, provided by the hardware and used by Triton
+- the hostname, provided by operators
 
-    headnode$ manta-adm cn -o host,server_uuid,admin_ip RM08218
+CNs also have a hardware configuration type (Shrimp, Richmond, Tenderloin, etc),
+a global zone IP, and a service processor IP.  Most of these are available from
+the `manta-adm cn` command.  As an example, to fetch the server uuid and global
+zone IP for RM08218, use:
+
+    # manta-adm cn -o host,server_uuid,admin_ip RM08218
     HOST     SERVER UUID                          ADMIN IP
     RM08218  00000000-0000-0000-0000-00259094c058 10.10.0.34
 
-For more information, see `manta-adm help cn`.
+See the `manta-adm(1)` manual page for details.
+
+## Locating storage ids and compute ids
+
+Manta Storage CNs have additional identifiers:
+
+- a manta compute id, used by the jobs subsystem.
+- one or more manta storage ids, used for object metadata.  There's one storage
+  id per storage zone deployed on a server, so there can be more than one
+  storage id per CN, although this is usually only the case in development
+  environments.
+
+You can generate a table that maps hostnames to compute id and storage ids for
+the current datacenter:
+
+    # manta-adm cn -o host,compute_id,storage_ids storage
+    HOST     COMPUTE ID               STORAGE IDS
+    RM08213  12.cn.us-east.joyent.us  2.stor.us-east.joyent.us
+    RM08211  20.cn.us-east.joyent.us  1.stor.us-east.joyent.us
+    RM08216  19.cn.us-east.joyent.us  3.stor.us-east.joyent.us
+    RM08219  11.cn.us-east.joyent.us  4.stor.us-east.joyent.us
+
+Note that the column name is "storage\_ids" (with a trailing "s") since there
+may be more than one.
 
-To find a manta zone, log into one of the headnodes and run `manta-adm show`.
+See the `manta-adm(1)` manual page for details.
+
+## Locating Manta component zones
+
+To find a particular manta zone, log into one of the headnodes and run
+`manta-adm show`.  You can list all of the zones in all datacenters with
+`manta-adm show -a`.

-## Translating from mantaComputeId or mantaStorageId to hostname
-
-While each system has its own hostname and server_uuid, Manta also assigns a
-separate "storage id" (mantaStorageId) for storage nodes and a "compute id"
-(mantaComputeId) for all nodes.  These identifiers are distinct from the
-hostname and server_uuid in order to support recovery from a failed system.
-
-To translate from a mantaComputeId or a mantaStorageId to a server name, use
-"manta-adm cn":
-
-    [root@headnode (us-east-2) ~]# manta-adm cn -o host,compute_id,storage_ids
-    HOST     COMPUTE ID               STORAGE IDS
