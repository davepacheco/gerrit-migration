I\u0027ve basically abstracted the check, so now instead of passing in a name, you pass in a function which can do the check and return whether or not the update has been applied. This was so I could reuse this function to check for the resize update as well.\n","createdOn":1486088844,"lastUpdated":1486091288,"open":false,"status":"ABANDONED","comments":[{"timestamp":1486088844,"reviewer":{"name":"Andrew Wharton","email":"andrew@whartonlabs.com","username":"andrew-wharton"},"message":"Uploaded patch set 1."},{"timestamp":1486088873,"reviewer":{"name":"Joyent Automation","username":"joyent-automation"},"message":"Patch Set 1: CI-Testing+1\n\n\"make check\" passed ok"},{"timestamp":1486091288,"reviewer":{"name":"Andrew Wharton","email":"andrew@whartonlabs.com","username":"andrew-wharton"},"message":"Abandoned\n\nCreated in error as I didn\u0027t squash my commits before pushing"}],"currentPatchSet":{"number":"1","revision":"23ccc86666d824727d648ec745d1d07878ecacdb","parents":["8777840b0e774bc54ff9c0bece164662c4a55b0c"],"ref":"refs/changes/12/1412/1","uploader":{"name":"Andrew Wharton","email":"andrew@whartonlabs.com","username":"andrew-wharton"},"createdOn":1486088844,"author":{"name":"Andrew Wharton","email":"andrew@whartonlabs.com","username":"andrew-wharton"},"isDraft":false,"kind":"REWORK","approvals":[{"type":"CI-Testing","description":"CI-Testing","value":"1","grantedOn":1486088873,"by":{"name":"Joyent Automation","username":"joyent-automation"}}],"files":[{"file":"/COMMIT_MSG","type":"ADDED","insertions":9,"deletions":0},{"file":"lib/tritonapi.js","type":"MODIFIED","insertions":90,"deletions":-8}],"sizeInsertions":90,"sizeDeletions":-8},"patchSets":[{"number":"1","revision":"23ccc86666d824727d648ec745d1d07878ecacdb","parents":["8777840b0e774bc54ff9c0bece164662c4a55b0c"],"ref":"refs/changes/12/1412/1","uploader":{"name":"Andrew Wharton","email":"andrew@whartonlabs.com","username":"andrew-wharton"},"createdOn":1486088844,"author":{"name":"Andrew Wharton","email":"andrew@whartonlabs.com","username":"andrew-wharton"},"isDraft":false,"kind":"REWORK","approvals":[{"type":"CI-Testing","description":"CI-Testing","value":"1","grantedOn":1486088873,"by":{"name":"Joyent Automation","username":"joyent-automation"}}],"files":[{"file":"/COMMIT_MSG","type":"ADDED","insertions":9,"deletions":0},{"file":"lib/tritonapi.js","type":"MODIFIED","insertions":90,"deletions":-8}],"sizeInsertions":90,"sizeDeletions":-8}],"allReviewers":[{"name":"Joyent Automation","username":"joyent-automation"}]}
