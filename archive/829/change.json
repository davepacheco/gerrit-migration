However, modifying a node module is not the correct path to make this change. While this is third party software that\u0027s checked in, it still must be treated as third party software. The means we generally first work with the provider of it to make these changes before we make changes here. However, in this case, I\u0027m not sure that this change is correct.\n\nMore broadly, we need to understand *why* we\u0027re getting EBUSY here. Just retrying blindly won\u0027t necessarily solve anything and likely will hide the real underlying bug."},{"timestamp":1483646976,"reviewer":{"name":"Trent Mick","email":"trentm@gmail.com","username":"trentm"},"message":"Abandoned"}],"currentPatchSet":{"number":"1","revision":"82e16ebf642c6d703cba61ebaaca4fa7b9ef2cca","parents":["eb48990c0db8917664800dbfd46c2a2fe7a3e102"],"ref":"refs/changes/29/829/1","uploader":{"name":"Chayeon Hong","email":"chayeon.hong@samsung.com","username":"chayeon"},"createdOn":1477987801,"author":{"name":"Chayeon Hong","email":"chayeon.hong@samsung.com","username":"chayeon"},"isDraft":false,"kind":"REWORK","approvals":[{"type":"CI-Testing","description":"CI-Testing","value":"1","grantedOn":1477987839,"by":{"name":"Joyent Automation","username":"joyent-automation"}},{"type":"Code-Review","description":"Code-Review","value":"-1","grantedOn":1478013639,"by":{"name":"Robert Mustacchi","email":"rm+illumos@fingolfin.org","username":"rmustacc"}}],"files":[{"file":"/COMMIT_MSG","type":"ADDED","insertions":7,"deletions":0},{"file":"src/img/node_modules/rimraf/rimraf.js","type":"MODIFIED","insertions":1,"deletions":-1}],"sizeInsertions":1,"sizeDeletions":-1},"patchSets":[{"number":"1","revision":"82e16ebf642c6d703cba61ebaaca4fa7b9ef2cca","parents":["eb48990c0db8917664800dbfd46c2a2fe7a3e102"],"ref":"refs/changes/29/829/1","uploader":{"name":"Chayeon Hong","email":"chayeon.hong@samsung.com","username":"chayeon"},"createdOn":1477987801,"author":{"name":"Chayeon Hong","email":"chayeon.hong@samsung.com","username":"chayeon"},"isDraft":false,"kind":"REWORK","approvals":[{"type":"Code-Review","description":"Code-Review","value":"-1","grantedOn":1478013639,"by":{"name":"Robert Mustacchi","email":"rm+illumos@fingolfin.org","username":"rmustacc"}},{"type":"CI-Testing","description":"CI-Testing","value":"1","grantedOn":1477987839,"by":{"name":"Joyent Automation","username":"joyent-automation"}}],"files":[{"file":"/COMMIT_MSG","type":"ADDED","insertions":7,"deletions":0},{"file":"src/img/node_modules/rimraf/rimraf.js","type":"MODIFIED","insertions":1,"deletions":-1}],"sizeInsertions":1,"sizeDeletions":-1}],"allReviewers":[{"name":"Robert Mustacchi","email":"rm+illumos@fingolfin.org","username":"rmustacc"},{"name":"Joyent Automation","username":"joyent-automation"},{"name":"Trent Mick","email":"trentm@gmail.com","username":"trentm"}]}
