We\u0027re still slowly learning about all the operational implications of adjusting these, but some things we can state:\n\n* The \"spares\" for the mahi pool should be higher than \"spares\" for the sharks (by a factor probably less than an order of magnitude, but more than 2). The mahi pool is shared out amongst all requests so it needs to keep more spare capacity and react faster to load transients.\n* We don\u0027t want a huge number of \"spares\" for shark pools, or we will have a lot of pointless idle sockets lying around. While this shouldn\u0027t present any scalability problems, it\u0027s a point of prudence to avoid it if we can. So I picked 2 for the \"spares\" there.\n* In my experiments, the average muskie process can handle about 100-200 reqs/sec on emy-15. This means the absolute minimum socket ceiling we want to have is around 15 assuming a max mahi request time of 60ms. I picked 200 to be \"well above\" this, though I expect to have to keep an eye on it in deployment and perhaps adjust.\n* The maximum socket cap per shark I picked as 2000 in a similar kind of fashion.\n\nThe timeouts are very finger-in-the-air numbers as well, in general, at the moment, though the SRV numbers are picked particularly with reference to MANTA-3017 and the issues surrounding it.\n\nWe have had some experience with cueball timeouts in CNS and CloudAPI, FWIW, and found that generally the base timeout should be no less than 2000ms (or else we get false failures a lot under load), and 3-5 retries is a good level for determining when a backend is \"dead\".\n\nBasically the plan is to try these numbers out and adjust them as needed."},{"file":"sapi_manifests/muskie/template","line":39,"reviewer":{"name":"Jordan Hendricks","email":"jordan.hendricks@joyent.com","username":"jordanhendricks"},"message":"Great, thanks for the writeup.
