 mooremachine
 ============
 
+Short version
+-------------
+
+This is a framework for organising your async node.js code as Moore
+Finite State Machines. FSMs can be easier to reason about and debug than
+implicit state kept in callbacks and objects, leading to more correct code.
+
+License and contributing
