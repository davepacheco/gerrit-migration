 # mantamon
@@ -14,48 +14,7 @@ This repository is part of the Joyent Manta project.  For contribution
 guidelines, issues, and general documentation, visit the main
 [Manta](http://github.com/joyent/manta) project page.
 
-This repo contains `mantamon`, which is the administrative tool that manages
-operational bits for Manta.  You should be familiar with Amon already, so if
-you're not, go get familar.
-
-This tool is installed in each datacenter where Manta is running, and manages
-probes/alarms for that datacenter.
-
-There is full documentation installed with it as a manpage, so in a manta
-deployment zone just do `man mantamon`.
-
-However, if you're an engineer and want to define additional probes for manta,
-read on.
-
-
-# Probes
-
-All probe files are stored by role under `/probes`.  In addition there is a
-`common` directory that *all* roles will also pull in (the exception being
-`compute`, which does not pull those in).
-
-The probe files themselves are just JSON blobs that match what Amon wants,
-minus the `agent` bit.  If you want a probe to run in the GZ of a service's
-zone, just set the field `global: true` in the JSON blob (this is not an
-Amon thing, but mantamon figures it out for you).
-
-
-# Testing changes
-
-Run "make prepush" to run sanity checks and basic tests.  Before running, note
-that the tests assume:
-
-* You have a configuration file called "etc/config.json" relative to the
-  root of this repository, and it's correct for your SDC installation.  You can
-  use the template COAL configuration file in "etc/" as a start for this file.
-* Your dev environment has nameservers configured that will resolve the
-  hostnames in that configuration file (i.e., you can resolve the SDC hostnames
-  that appear in that config file).  If not, make sure your dev zone is on the
-  "admin" network for your SDC install and add at least one SDC resolver to
-  /etc/resolv.conf.
-* You have deployed Manta.
-* As part of your Manta deployment, you have configured alarms (i.e., run
-  "mantamon add").
-
-These tests are not a substitute for testing your change.  They're just sanity
-checks.
+**This repository is deprecated.**  The tool and configuration have been
+replaced with `manta-adm alarm`, as described under [RFD
+85](https://github.com/joyent/rfd/blob/master/rfd/0085/README.md) and
+[MANTA-3195](https://smartos.org/bugview/MANTA-3195).
