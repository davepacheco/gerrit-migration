You have new test suite changes to cover that, but showing that this works will prove that the SAPI services are created and their corresponding image UUIDs are correct, ensuring that the new \"imageName\" property is doing what we expect. I could be wrong, but I don\u0027t think this is implied by `manta-adm update` working.\n\nI think your testing notes show that you ran a `manta-adm show -js` to get your `/var/tmp/root/config.json` file, but I\u0027m not sure. Does `manta-adm show -js` work as expected?\n\nI don\u0027t think in this case we need to prove that Manta installs from scratch with this change.
