Changes I\u0027d like to see:\n\n- the plugin manager plugin loading should more gracefully handle the old\n  API to give guidance\n- the cloudapi/docs/admin.md docs miss some fields. I think these ones:\n    ```\n        datacenterName: app.config.datacenter_name,\n        service: \u0027cloudapi\u0027,\n        NotAuthorizedError: require(\u0027restify\u0027).NotAuthorizedError,\n    ```\n- Marsell mentioned writing \"upgrade\" docs for plugin authors. Did that get\n  written?\n- package.json minor version bump please\n- update to the \"Versions\" section of docs/index.md (the best changelog we have... tho that is somewhat more for users more than for operators) to describe the plugin api breakage.\n\n\nThis could be in a separate change (though should be easy):\n\n- `opts` passed to plugin hooks should get the `log` entry and jpc-preprovision.js\n  should be updated to use that. It should pass in `req.log`. Without that\n  change the jpc-preprovision.js plugin\u0027s logging is hamstrung: the log records\n  won\u0027t be associated with the req (other than proximity in time in the log\n  file)"},{"timestamp":1521088932,"reviewer":{"name":"Marsell Kukuljevic","email":"marsell@joyent.com","username":"marsell"},"message":"Uploaded patch set 3."},{"timestamp":1521088967,"reviewer":{"name":"Joyent Automation","username":"joyent-automation"},"message":"Patch Set 3: CI-Testing+1\n\n\"make check\" passed ok"},{"timestamp":1521089526,"reviewer":{"name":"Marsell Kukuljevic","email":"marsell@joyent.com","username":"marsell"},"message":"Patch Set 3:\n\nWhen I asked around, I was told that JPC is the only place that we\u0027re aware of custom plugins (or any plugins really) being used.
