+# Contributing
+
+This repo __does not use GitHub pull requests__. Instead it uses
+[cr.joyent.us](https://cr.joyent.us) (Gerrit) for new changes. Anyone can submit
+changes. To get started, see the [cr.joyent.us user
+guide](https://github.com/joyent/joyent-gerrit/blob/master/docs/user/README.md).
+
+See the [Joyent Engineering
+Guidelines](https://github.com/joyent/eng/blob/master/docs/index.md) for general
+best practices expected in this repository.
+
+Contributions should be "make prepush" clean.  The "prepush" target runs the
+"check" target, which requires these separate tools:
+
+* https://github.com/davepacheco/jsstyle
+* https://github.com/davepacheco/javascriptlint
+
+If you're changing something non-trivial or user-facing, you may want to submit
+an issue first.
