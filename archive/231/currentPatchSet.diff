-# Overview

-When an SmartDataCenter server starts up, it will require a way of
-setting up the server, boot-strapping various sub-systems such as zpool
-creation, agents, etc, based on the configuration and role of the machine. The
-node agent Ur, will listen on AMQP for scripts to execute.

 It's important to note, however, that we will not be able to update the
 operating system live image, so the Ur agent must be reasonably future proof.
