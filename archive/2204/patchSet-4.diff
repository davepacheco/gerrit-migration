+# EXPENSIVE TARGETS AND MAKE STAMP FILES
+#
+# Targets which are expensive to run and lack a single file that marks
+# completion are difficult to track with make; e.g., "npm install".  One
+# solution to this problem is to create "stamp" files with symbolic names which
+# are created as the final step in a complex make rule in order to mark
+# completion.
+#
+# In order to make these more uniform, and easier to target with "make clean",
+# we will attempt to store them under a single directory.  Note that these
+# files are never targets for shipping in build artefacts.
+#
+# Stamp-backed targets come in several parts.  First, a macro should be defined
+# which names a file in the MAKE_STAMPS_DIR directory.  Then, a target which
+# creates this stamp file must be provided.  The recipe for this target should
+# use MAKE_STAMP_REMOVE and MAKE_STAMP_CREATE to perform the appropriate stamp
+# management.
+#
+# For example:
+#
+# --- Makefile.*.defs:
+#
+#	$(STAMP_EXPENSIVE_RESULT) := $(MAKE_STAMPS_DIR)/expensive-result
+#
+# --- Makefile.*.targ:
+#
+#	$(STAMP_EXPENSIVE_RESULT): input/file another/input/file
+#		$(MAKE_STAMP_REMOVE)
+#		rm -rf output_tree/  # <--- ensure a clean slate
+#		expensive_program -o output_tree/ $^
+#		$(MAKE_STAMP_CREATE)
+#
+# NOTE: Every stamp file is exposed as an implicit "stamp-$STAMP_NAME" target.
+# The example above could be built manually by invoking:
+#
+#	make stamp-expensive-result

+# Makefile.node_modules.defs: Makefile for using NPM modules.
+#
+# NOTE: This makefile comes from the "eng" repo. It's designed to be dropped
+# into other repos as-is without requiring any modifications. If you find
+# yourself changing this file, you should instead update the original copy in
+# eng.git and then update your repo to use the new version.
+#
+
+#
+# This Makefile provides a target for building NPM modules from the dependency
+# information in the "package.json" file.  The "npm install" operation is
+# expensive and produces a complex (multi-file) result which is difficult for
+# make to use in dependency analysis.  As such, we use a "stamp" file to track
+# successful completion of module installation.
+#
+# The following variables are used to track the location of inputs
+# and outputs to the "npm install" operation.  It is not expected that the
+# consumer will need to override these.
+#
+#	NODE_PACKAGE_JSON	The location of "package.json", which is
+#				generally implicitly discovered by "npm install"
+#				in the current directory.
+#
+#	NODE_MODULES		The location of the module installation
+#				directory, which is generally "node_modules"
+#				in the same directory as "package.json".
+#
+# Consumers should, for targets which depend on the installation of NPM
+# modules, depend on the stamp file using the $(STAMP_NODE_MODULES) variable,
+# e.g.:
+#
+#	.PHONY: all
+#	all: $(STAMP_NODE_MODULES)
+#
+# A phony target, "make stamp-node-modules", is also provided to allow the
+# engineer to manually perform NPM module installation without invoking other
+# targets.  Note that this target should _not_ be used as a dependency for
+# other targets in consuming Makefiles; using phony targets to represent
+# intermediate build stages can inhibit the ability of make to determine
+# when no additional actions are required.
