+# EXPENSIVE TARGETS AND MAKE STAMP FILES
+#
+# Targets which are expensive to run and lack a single file that marks
+# completion are difficult to track with make; e.g., "npm install".  One
+# solution to this problem is to create "stamp" files with symbolic names which
+# are created as the final step in a complex make rule in order to mark
+# completion.
+#
+# In order to make these more uniform, and easier to target with "make clean",
+# we will attempt to store them under a single directory.  Note that these
+# files are never targets for shipping in build artefacts.
+#
+# Stamp-backed targets come in several parts.  First, a macro should be defined
+# which names a file in the MAKE_STAMPS_DIR directory.  Then, a target which
+# creates this stamp file must be provided.  The recipe for this target should
+# use MAKE_STAMP_REMOVE and MAKE_STAMP_CREATE to perform the appropriate stamp
+# management.
+#
+# For example:
+#
+# --- Makefile.*.defs:
+#
+#	$(STAMP_EXPENSIVE_RESULT) := $(MAKE_STAMPS_DIR)/expensive-result
+#
+# --- Makefile.*.targ:
+#
+#	$(STAMP_EXPENSIVE_RESULT): input/file another/input/file
+#		$(MAKE_STAMP_REMOVE)
+#		rm -rf output_tree/  # <--- ensure a clean slate
+#		expensive_program -o output_tree/ $^
+#		$(MAKE_STAMP_CREATE)
+#
+# NOTE: Every stamp file is exposed as an implicit "stamp-$STAMP_NAME" target.
+# The example above could be built manually by invoking:
+#
+#	make stamp-expensive-result
